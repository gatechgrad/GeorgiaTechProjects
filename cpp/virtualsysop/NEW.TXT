 "I know that now... Fat lot of good it does me."
Welcome new system operator!
You have just spent a long time and a good bit of money to get your computer
and software ready to go on-line. Someone gave you an old IBM XT that they were
going to toss in the trash. You got a shareware BBS program and a cheap modem
and now you are ready to start accepting calls.

The local system operators' group welcomes you as a member of their community!
Most of them wish you the best of luck with your BBS and users.

The local directory of Bulletin Board Systems needs some information from you.
In order to keep our records straight we need to know the name that you call
your BBS in this game. The list has space for up to 30 characters.

                        [..............................]
What is your BBS called?
