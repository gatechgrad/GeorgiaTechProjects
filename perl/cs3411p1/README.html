<P><B><FONT size=+2>Computing Document Similarities</FONT></B> 
<P>For your <B>first programming assignment</B> this quarter, you will complete 
a <B>Perl code framework</B> for computing the similarity between two text 
documents (files) expressed as a real number between 0 and 1.0. Two identical 
documents will report a similarity factor of 1.0. Two completely distinct 
documents will have a similarity factor of 0.0. So how do we assign a 
<B>similarity factor</B>? The technique used by most Web search engines looks at 
the number of <B>common "terms"</B> appearing in both documents. Documents with 
more common terms receive a higher similarity rating. This approach assumes that 
two documents talking about the same thing will use the same vocabulary. This 
works most of the time but fails badly when people use completely distinct but 
synonymous terminology. For example, one document might describe flashlights, 
while a British version of the same document might talk about "torches". The 
term frequency approach also fails when the same word has two distinct meanings 
and will relate documents describing gasoline drums and snare drums. Still, the 
longer the document, the less likely that ALL terms will fall into one of these 
two bad cases. 
<P>Perl is an excellent language for writing a document similarity program. It 
has sophisticated text manipulation capabilities and powerful operations on 
dynamic lists (arrays) and associative arrays (hashtables or, in Perl lingo, 
"hashes") that relate a key and a value. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Terms</FONT></B> 
<P>To compare two documents, we begin by assembling a list of terms appearing in 
each document. Consider terms to be character sequences separated by whitespace. 
We will "clean up" the terms by removing funny punctuation and digits and 
lowercasing everything. (This is a bit extreme but works well for our simple 
version of the program. Real code removes commonly occuring terms, and prefixes 
and suffixes in a process called "stemming".) 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Term Frequencies</FONT></B> 
<P>Along with a list of terms appearing in each document, we will count the 
<B>frequency of occurrence </B>of each term. This is per document. Some terms 
appear many times in one document and not at all in another document. We can 
easily store term frequencies in an associative array or hash where the key is 
the term and the value is the count. We will maintain two term frequency hashes, 
one for each document. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Dictionary</FONT></B> 
<P>Once we have term frequency hashes for each document, we can easily build a 
single list containing all terms. This list, called the <B>dictionary</B>, will 
contain a single occurrence (no duplicates) of each term appearing in either 
document. We will keep the dictionary in ascending sorted order. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Term Frequency "Vectors"</FONT></B> 
<P>This approach to document similarity is called the <B>vector space model</B> 
because it constructs a "vector" for each document that contains the frequency 
of occurrence of each word in the dictionary (the entire document collection) in 
that particular document. These are <B>"vectors"</B> in a <B>multi-dimensional 
"term space"</B> where there are as many dimensions as there are terms. We can 
compute a similarity factor by <B>computing the angle or distance</B> between 
these vectors. Before we do that, however, we will <B>weigh</B> and 
<B>normalize</B> these term vectors in various ways to produce more desirable 
results. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Inverse Document Frequencies</FONT></B> 
<P>Common terms appearing in a small number of documents are weighted more 
highly than terms appearing in all documents. The "document frequency" (df) is 
the number of documents in which a term appears once or more. Since we are 
working with a two document collection, this is a simple value. If the term 
appears in both documents its df is 2, otherwise it is 1 (it must appear in at 
least one document to even appear in the dictionary). We can use a hash to 
calculate this number for each word in the dictionary. Once we have the document 
frequencies, we just invert the value. Salton et al. suggest scaling these 
values as follows where N is the number of documents in the collection (2 in our 
case): 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idf<SUB>i</SUB> = log ( 1 + ( N / df<SUB>i</SUB> ) ) 
<P>This scaling factor seems to work well empirically. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Normalization Factors</FONT></B> 
<P>If we don't "normalize" the term frequencies, long documents will have higher 
similarity than short documents. We need to compute a normalization factor for 
each document. When we compute the weighted term vectors, we will divide each 
weighted frequency by the normalization factor. This ensures that the resulting 
vectors are unit vectors in the multi-dimensional term space. To normalize a 
two-dimensional vector (x,y), just divide each component by the length of the 
vector. That's just the square root of the sum of <BR>the squares of the 
components by a simple application of the Pythagorian Theorem: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nf = sqrt( x*x + y*y ) 
<P>The components of the term frequency vectors are the individual term factors 
(tf) multiplied by the inverse document frequency (idf) of each term: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tf<SUB>i</SUB> * idf<SUB>i</SUB> 
<P>so the corresponding equation is: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nf<B> </B>= sqrt( SUM<SUB>i</SUB>(&nbsp; (tf<SUB>i</SUB> * 
idf<SUB>i</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; ) ) 
<P>where SUM<SUB>i</SUB> means the sum over all terms in the document. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Weighted Term Vectors</FONT></B> 
<P>The heart of the algorithm is producing the weighted term vectors for each 
document. We will represent each vector as a list of real numbers. Each value in 
this list is associated with the corresponding term in the dictionary (they are 
"parallel arrays"). If a word doesn't appear in the document, its weight is 0. 
If it appears in the document, then the weighted value is: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w<SUB>i</SUB> = ( tf<SUB>i</SUB> * idf<SUB>i</SUB> ) / nf 
<P>Since these values are normalized, they should be between 0 and 1.0. If you 
have properly normalized the vectors, compute the sum of the squares of all the 
elements. The square root of this value should be 1.0 by the Pythagorian 
theorem. 
<P><B><FONT size=+1>Computing Similarity</FONT></B> 
<P>Once we have the two weighted term frequency vectors (one for each document) 
computing document similarity is very easy. We just compute the <B>dot 
product</B> of the two vectors. Recall that the dot product is the sum of the 
product of related elements (multiply the first two elements, then multiply the 
second two and add the result and so forth.) Since the vectors have been 
normalized (they are unit vectors), the result is guaranteed to be between 0 and 
1.0.

href="http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/journals/cacm/1994-37-2/p97-salton">CACM 
article</A> by Salton, Allan and Buckley. 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>How Do I Start?</FONT></B> 
<P>Copy the code framework <TT><FONT size=+2><A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs3411_99_summer/sim.pl">sim.pl</A></FONT></TT> 
to a system that has a Perl 5 interpreter (type "perl -v" to check). Perl is 
very portable and you should be able to develop your program under Windows or 
Linux but we have Perl 5 installed on all the CoC machines and on acme. Under 
UNIX, you need to make this file executable: 
<P><TT><FONT size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp; chmod +x sim.pl</FONT></TT> 
<P>The framework requires two filenames as commandline arguments so you can 
invoke it like this: 
<P>&nbsp;<TT><FONT size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp; sim.pl file1 file2</FONT></TT> 
<P>The framework has all the data structures declared and calls the appropriate 
subroutines but does nothing so it will print out some debugging information and 
report a similarity of 0.0 for any files you supply. 
<P>The framework is heavily commented. You should begin by examining the 
contents carefully. Here is the beginning of the file showing the "main" part of 
the script. 
<P><TT>###</TT> <BR><TT># MAIN --</TT> <BR><TT># Perl programs don't have an 
explicit "main". Perl will execute all code in</TT> <BR><TT># the file outside 
of subroutine definitions.</TT> <BR><TT>###</TT> 
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # require two filenames as cmd line args; remember the 
names</TT> <BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @ARGV == 2 || die "Usage: sim &lt;fn1&gt; 
&lt;fn2&gt;\n";</TT> <BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( $f1, $f2 ) = @ARGV;</TT> 
<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getTerms();</TT> <BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
computeTFs();</TT> <BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buildDict();</TT> 
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; computeIDFs();</TT> <BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
computeNFs();</TT> <BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; computeWeights();</TT> 
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $sim = computeSimilarity();</TT> 
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....</TT> 
<P>This is a great program to develop INCREMENTALLY. Begin with getTerms(), the 
subroutine that opens the two files, and creates term lists. Once you get that 
working, start on computeTFs(), the routine that computes term frequencies. 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>Perl Stuff</FONT></B> 
<P>You will probably end up loving and hating Perl at the same time. Larry Wall, 
the designer of Perl, is an old time UNIX hacker and one of his mantras is 
"There's More Than One Way To Do It". At first you will be overwhelmed by all 
the capabilities of Perl. Once you learn some tricks you will start appreciating 
how powerful and expressive the language is. Then you will spend hours debugging 
a strange problem involving a special case of some strange feature and you will 
start hating Perl again. 
<P>Perl is semi-compiled. Each time you run a script, the interpreter scans the 
entire file and compiles it into a fast intermediate representation that is then 
interpreted. Under UNIX, the file must be executable and begin with a special 
line indicating the location of a perl5 interpreter. On the CoC machines that 
would be: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #!/usr/local/perl5/bin/perl 
<P>A Perl file consists of executable statements and subroutine definitions. 
Subroutine definitions cannot be nested (like C, unlike Pascal). There is no 
explicit main() in Perl. The interpreter simply executes all the statements in 
the file. 
<P><B>Variables</B> 
<P>Perl does not require variables to be declared. This is convenient but 
dangerous. I will ask you to "declare" all variables using the special function 
"my". To declare and initialize a variable you can say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my $total = 0; 
<P>You can declare several at once like this: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my ( $term, $i, $nterms ); 
<P><B>Types</B> 
<P>Perl has a strange and flexible notion of data types. All variable names 
begin with a special character that indicates the "type" of the variable: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $scalar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (number or string or 
boolean) <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @list&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(array) <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %hash&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (associative 
array: key-value pairs) 
<P>Lists and hashes are dynamic and grow and shrink on demand up to the size of 
available memory. Perl follows the 0-1-infinity rule everywhere. The various 
"types" have separate namespaces so $name and @name are different things and may 
both exist in the same program. 
<P>Command line arguments are made available to the program through a special 
array called @ARGV. 
<P><B>Lists / Arrays</B> 
<P>Perl has a notion of "contexts", places where either a scalar or a list or a 
hash is expected. Sometimes the meaning of a variable depends on the context. 
For example, an array name like @list, returns the number of elements in the 
list when used in a "scalar context". For example: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my $n = @list;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # scalar context so @list 
returns list size 
<P>In other situations, it refers to the entire list: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @list = ( 1, 2, 3, 4 
);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
# a list context <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @list = ( 1, 2, 3, $n, 5, 6 
);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # memory is dynamically allocated 
<P>Lists can also be viewed as arrays and stacks when accessed appropriately: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; push( @list, 10 ); <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my 
$value = pop( @list ); 
<P>You can select array elements using the standard square bracket notation but 
Perl requires that you use $ before the array name when selecting an element 
(this emphasizes that the result of selecting an element is a scalar, not a 
list): 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my $third = $list[2];&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # array subscripts 
begin at 0 
<P>There are lots and lots of powerful array functions and operations: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my @sorted = sort( @list ); 
<P>Perl lets you leave off parentheses in function calls if you like. (It can do 
this because variables begin with special symbols so the parser can figure it 
out.) 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my @sorted = sort @list; 
<P>Assigning to an undefined element implicitly grows the list. If you assign 
way past the end, the elements between the new one and the last one have the 
special value undef. Touching an undef value will generate a warning. You can 
test whether a value is defined using the function: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( defined( $list[100] ) ) { ... } 
<P><B>Printing</B> 
<P>There are two ways to print in Perl: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "hello, world\n"; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printf "%s 
%s\n", $word1, $word2; 
<P>The print command has an interesting capability called "variable 
interpolation" that evaluates variable references inside quoted strings: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $whatever = "world!"; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "hello, 
$whatever\n";&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # produces "hello, world!" 
<P>There is a string concatenation operator (.) but you don't need it very 
often. 
<P><B>Regular Expressions / Substitute</B> 
<P>Perl has a wide variety of capabilities for using regular expressions to 
manipulate text. Regular expressions (res) are delimited by forward slashes so: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /abc/ 
<P>matches the string "abc" (using the implicit concatenation operator). 
Alternation (|) and Kleene closure (*) are also available along with the 
extensions we discussed: ^ $ . + (). Perl has several predefined "character 
class abbreviations". For example: \d is the same as [0-9], \s matches a single 
whitespace character and \w matches a letter, digit or underscore. There are 
negated versions of these classes so \D matches any character that is NOT a 
digit and so forth. The special abbreviation \b matches a "word boundary" 
something like ^ and $ match a "line boundary". Comparing a string with a re 
returns true or false and is done with the binary "match" operator (=~) like 
this:<BR><BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( $name&nbsp;&nbsp; =~ /\b[Pp]hil/ ) { 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # do something 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<P>A special notation is useful for matching and then replacing or substituting. 
A similar syntax can be used in most text editors: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $which = "this is a test"; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $which 
=~ s/test/quiz/;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # replace test with quiz in $which 
<P>There are zillions of other re capabilities in Perl. Checkout one of the Perl 
texts or the recent O'Reilly book "Mastering Regular Expressions" for details. 
<P><B>Split / Join / Translate</B> 
<P>The split function takes a regular expression and a string. Parts of the 
string that DO NOT match the regular expression are returned in sequence as a 
list of values. split can be used to "tokenize" strings. You can breakup a 
tab-delimited string into pieces like this: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $s = "a\tb\tc\t\d"; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @pieces = 
split( /\t/, $s ); 
<P>Split behaves a bit strangely if you split a string with leading whitespace 
so either read the manual carefully or be sure to trim any leading whitespace 
before you split. 
<P>The join function is the companion to split. You give it a "glue string" and 
an array and it returns one big string created by gluing the individual elements 
together. To put the string above back together we could write: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $s2 = join( "\t", @pieces ); 
<P>Finally, there is an operator called tr (named after the UNIX tr command) 
that allows you to replace or remove individual characters in a string. You 
provide two lists of characters. Characters in the first list are replaced by 
characters in the second list. Syntactically tr looks like the substitute 
command: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $name = tr/a-z/A-Z/;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # translate 
lowercase letters to uppercase <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $name = 
tr/aeiou//d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # delete vowels 
<P>Notice that you use an assignment operator and not the matching operator 
(=~). Also, tr does not support general regular expressions. About the only 
special character you can have between the forward slashes is the dash for 
defining ranges. 
<P><B>Subroutines / Parameters / Locals / Globals</B> 
<P>Defining a subroutine is simple, just say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sub mySub { <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
statements; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $result = mySub( $one, $two, $three ); 
<P>Paremeter passing is a bit unusual. Every sub implicitly receives a single 
parameter with the name @_ <BR>which is a list of the parameters provided to the 
subroutine (it's kind of like @ARGV). It is common to assign these parameters to 
named local variables using a statement like this: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my ( $p1, $p2, $p3 ) = @_; 
<P>This is actually just a special case of&nbsp; "array assignment". For 
example: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( $f1, $f2 ) = @ARGV; 
<P>accesses and assigns the first two elements of the list @ARGV to the 
specified variables. If there are additional elements in @ARGV, they are 
ignored. If there are not enough, the unlucky variables take on the value undef. 

<P>Variables "declared" with my inside a subroutine are local to that function. 
Variables declared outside any subroutine are global. 
<P>It is possible to return values from a subroutine. If no explicit return is 
included, the value of the last expression evaluated in the subroutine is used 
as the subroutine value (like LISP). It is possible to return multiple values 
from a subroutine as a list: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( $min, $max ) = minmax( $a, $b ); 
<P><B>Input / Filehandles</B> 
<P>Perl has an abstraction of a UNIX file pointer called a filehandle. They look 
like variable names in all caps. Two are provided by default: STDIN and STDOUT. 
To read a line as a string from STDIN, just say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; 
<P>$line will contain a terminating NEWLINE which can be removed by the chomp 
function: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chomp $line; 
<P>Evaluating &lt;STDIN&gt; by itself places a copy of the line in the special 
variable $_. This special variable is the default for all sorts of Perl 
commands, like print. To echo a file, removing all the newlines,&nbsp; you can 
just say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while ( &lt;STDIN&gt; ) { 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chomp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # using 
$_ <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
print;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # using $_ <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<P>It is possible to associate a filehandle with a file or process using 
open(..): 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open( MYFILE, "pathname" ); 
<P>The &lt;&gt; operators have a special meaning when used in a "list context". 
If you say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @lines = &lt;MYFILE&gt;; 
<P>Perl will create an array containing ALL the lines from the specified file! 
<P><B>Hashes</B> 
<P>One of the more powerful features of Perl are its dynamic hash tables. 
Variables begining with % are hashes. They can be explicitly initialized by key, 
value pairs. Or you can simply add elements one at a time. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my %hash = (); 
<P>To add or update an element in a hash say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $hash{$key} = $value; 
<P>To delete an element say: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delete $hash{$key}; 
<P>If you request a key that is not in the hash, the value undef is returned: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( !defined( $hash{$key} ) ) { 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $hash{$key} = 0; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<P>Actually there is a special rule for hashes that allows you to simplify the 
above code when you are counting things. The expression: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $hash{$key}++; 
<P>will increment the value associated with $key if defined. If you try to 
increment a key that is not in the hash, Perl will initialize the element to 1 
for you! 
<P>The keys function returns a list of the keys of a hash: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @keys = keys %hash; 
<P>The values function returns a list of the values: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @values = values %hash; 
<P>These are returned in an unpredicatable order but the elements of the two 
lists correspond. It is possible to iterate through the elements of a hash with 
the each function: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while ( ($key,$value) = each(%hash) ) { 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "$value $key"; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<P><B>Looping</B> 
<P>Perl has standard for, while and do-while loops from C along with a do-until 
loop that allows you to specifiy a termination condition for a post-test loop. 
In addition, Perl has a very useful foreach statement that allows you to iterate 
through the elements of a list: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my $element; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach $element 
(@list) { <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "$element\n"; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } 
<P><B>Strange Flow Control</B> (||, &amp;&amp;, if, unless) 
<P>There is no switch statement in Perl but it is possible to build an 
equivalent structure several different ways. In addition, Perl has a few unusual 
control flow techniques. The short-circuited boolean operators are commonly used 
for flow control. Here is an example using the die() function that prints an 
error message and terminates the progam: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open( MYFILE, $filename ) || die "Can't open file 
$filename\n"; 
<P>If the open() succeeds then the die() function is never called. 
<P>Perl also allows the programmer to add conditionals like if and unless to the 
END of a statement. This occasionally increases the clarity of code: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $n = $list[$i] if defined( $list[$i] ); 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $n = sqrt( $x ) unless $x&lt;0; 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>Helpful Advice</FONT></B>
