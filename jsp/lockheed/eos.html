<h2>
Summary of Significant Accomplishments for the Semester</h2>

<ul>Our group this semester made significant progress in the development
of Project Notebook, a system that will have the ability to monitor and
edit every kind of device that is put in place on Lockheed’s military ships.&nbsp;
This semester’s team has collaborated with our Lockheed clients numerous
times to create a database that will enable users to monitor large amounts
of data quickly and efficiently.
<br>Several weeks were spent at the beginning of the semester simply understanding
Lockheed’s overall problem.&nbsp; Though the semester before us provided
some initial documentation that was helpful, it was not adequate in gaining
a complete understanding of what type of system Lockheed wanted us to create.&nbsp;
Several conference calls and in-person meetings were set up with our clients,
allowing them to give us an overview of how a ship’s devices interact.&nbsp;
We created use cases to gain a better understanding of how the system should
function based on specific types of users.&nbsp; The previous semester’s
group created a database that was inadequate for our client’s needs.&nbsp;
Therefore, our goals for the semester changed from completing the entire
system to designing a back-end database for the system that next semester’s
group could build on without backtracking.&nbsp; As we developed and revised
the database, we accounted for the smaller, yet important details that
needed to be included in our system (such as behavior sets and behaviors
of devices).
<p>Prior to our database creation, requirements for the overall system
were created in an effort to help next semester’s team to better understand
the functionality of the system quickly.&nbsp; A testing environment has
also been created which allows the group here in Atlanta to collaborate
with our Lockheed clients.&nbsp; This on-line environment has helped our
group better understand the system requirements as well as the use cases
we created.&nbsp; Both our group and our clients in New Jersey have the
ability to post ideas and run SQL statements on our database through this
on-line tool.&nbsp; Future classes will be able to gain confidence in our
database design with the documentation at rootnode.&nbsp;&nbsp; This documentation
identifies system actors and requirements while providing a framework to
design and test the database.&nbsp; The documentation system remembers
all work.&nbsp; It records a history log to capture our thought process
as design and requirements change with understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; By allowing
future groups to see our thought progress they will be less likely to repeat
our mistakes and trust our design.&nbsp; Five UML diagrams were created
to serve as visual aid for understanding the documentation on rootnode.&nbsp;
The UML diagrams represent the database, actors, usecases and how they
all relate.&nbsp; These Diagrams are in PDF format and can be accessed
from the news room on rootnode.
<p>Once we created a reasonable design that&nbsp; satisfied Lockheed, our
group began work on a simple user interface that will be used to demonstrate
the functionality of our back-end.&nbsp; Sample screenshots have been made
for the major screens of the application, which can be used by next semester’s
group.&nbsp; Though our short-term plan changed drastically because it
was decided that the back end that last semester’s group created was inadequate,
we managed to fulfill all the goals we set for ourselves this semester.&nbsp;
We have created a fully functional back end data base written in SQL Server
for Project Notebook, we have created the SQL code which will query the
data base and will be used by next semester’s group in their UI, and we
have created a simple user interface which will be used in a demonstration
to our client.&nbsp; In addition, we have created and made available on
our web page extensive requirements documentation and electronic mail messages
we have used to express our ideas throughout the semester.
<p>Our team this semester will be leaving behind multiple significant documents
that can be used by next semester’s team to understand the client’s problem
and get started with the user interface design quickly.&nbsp; The programming
environment is completely set up with the applications needed on the server
laptop; therefore next semester’s group can begin development within the
first few weeks.&nbsp; All of our code for both the database and the user
interface is located on the server laptop because we have problems with
the client laptop.

<h2>
Problems Encountered this Semester</h2>
Though we did encounter several problems in the beginning of the semester,
our team managed to fulfill the goals that were set by our clients.&nbsp;
We were forced to change our short-term plan in the third week of this
semester.&nbsp; Last semester’s group provided a database in Microsoft
Access that we originally planned to export into SQL Server.&nbsp; Upon
examination of this database with our client, it was decided that the Access
database should not be used, but rather, we would need to create a new
one.&nbsp; Rather than working on the front-end aspects of this product
this semester, we changed our short-term plan so we would have the back
end completed instead.&nbsp; We have made many revisions and additions
to the database this semester, and it has been approved by our clients,
therefore this problem should not occur in the future.&nbsp; Problems such
as this can be partially avoided if the previous group provides ample documentation
along with the products they develop in the semester.
<p>We also ran into problems looking for necessary software licenses that
we needed in order to do development.&nbsp; Our clients wanted us to use
SQL Server to create our database, however licenses for this product are
expensive.&nbsp; We were able to obtain all the necessary software and
were doing development by the seventh week of the semester.&nbsp; Our team
has obtained all the software which will be needed to develop Lockheed’s
device monitoring system, therefore future groups working on this project
will simply need the server and client laptops which have been provided
for development.
<br>We had hardware problems with one of the laptops Lockheed provided
us as well.&nbsp; The client laptop was unable to connect to the LAN we
were using.&nbsp; This problem was solved after we changed operating systems
to Windows 98 as opposed to Windows NT, and should not happen again.
<p>Meeting with our clients has been difficult as well this semester.&nbsp;
Because our clients are located in Moorestown, New Jersey, we are only
able to meet with them via conference calls, though Scott Hoyle, our main
client, has met with us in person several times.&nbsp; Further, our clients
typically work until around 5:00 pm each day, and leave their office, while
the best time for our team to meet is usually at night after classes.&nbsp;
We handled this problem by having a scheduled meeting time of 11:00 am
every Friday, which was our regularly scheduled Real World Lab class time.&nbsp;
We did not meet with our client every week, but they were available at
that time for collaboration if we had questions.&nbsp; Future teams working
on Lockheed’s project should plan to have a tentative meeting time with
the client each week during the regular workday to keep communication open
with them.
<p>Finally, at times, communication within our group was difficult due
to everyone’s busy schedules.&nbsp; There were several instances of weekly
goals not being met simply because people were busy with other classes
or work.&nbsp; This did not cause major setbacks because other group members
helped to complete these unaccomplished tasks.&nbsp; To avoid this potentially
costly problem in the future, teams are encouraged to communicate problems
within the group, and if a task is more difficult than first expected,
group members should tell their manager as soon as possible.&nbsp; Team
members are encouraged to look at their schedules and recognize weeks when
they will be particularly busy with coursework from other classes as well,
and let their manager know that during those weeks, they will be unable
to help with the project as much as others.

<p>There are several risks which next semester’s team is encouraged to
address.&nbsp; First, the team may not be proficient in JSP or Java.&nbsp;
The programmers in the team are encouraged to learn Java and JSP as soon
as possible, perhaps asking the client to provide books on the two.&nbsp;
The team may take longer than expected to familiarize themselves with the
problem.&nbsp; To avoid this risk, next semester’s team is encouraged to
schedule a meeting with this semester’s group to have any questions answered
in the first few weeks.&nbsp; If new software is installed on the server
machine, there is a possibility of the machine crashing.&nbsp; It is recommended
that all code and the database be backed up on disk somewhere.</blockquote>
