<p><b><u><font size=+1>Introduction:</font></u></b>

<p>Lockheed Martin of Moorestown, NJ requested the services of the RWL

to design a flexible and robust information system for the management of

mechanical devices.&nbsp; The intent of this project is to provide an information

system for the data collected from these devices. The system will be flexible,

allowing for many types of devices. The system will also be modular; new

devices can be added at any time. Furthermore, the system will provide

an interface to the data. The interface presents instantaneous status information

and historical data for each device. The parameters of the system, such

as user access, device properties, and device reporting intervals, will

be configurable. Finally, the system will be redundant.

<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><u><font size=+1>Project Advisor:</font></u></b>

<p>The project advisor for the Lockheed Martin group is David Smith. &lt;rwlmgr@cc.gatech.edu>

We communicate with Professor Smith through weekly status emails and meetings

when necessary.&nbsp; The primary concern for our project advisor is to

guide our team and to keep us on the right track.

<br>&nbsp;

<p><b><u><font size=+1>Project Sponsor:</font></u></b>

<p>The main project sponsor for the Lockheed Martin group is Scott Hoyle

&lt;scott.b.hoyle@lmco.com>, manager of Advanced Control System Programs

of the Naval Electronics and Surveillance Systems division in Moorestown,

<b><u><font size=+1>Database Information Requirements:</font></u></b>

<p><b>Device Information</b>

<dir>

<li>

identifier, a location and a description.<br>
Test: Database contains name, id, location and description fields.<br>
</li>

<li>
2.2. Requirement: They each belong to a subsystem within a system.<br>
Test: All devices have a subsytem, or system, field which is filled out.<br>
</li>

<li>
2.3 Requirement: Each device has a physical installation and software updates that are 
done. We want to be able to record the time and date of each of these events as 
well as who did that task.<br>
Test: Database contains fields for each device which allow for dates and 
usernames for each of the tasks.<br>
</li>



<li>
2.4 Requirement: Various device types have various state data that they need to record 
(with a time stamp)<br>
Test: State data is stored for each device along with a corresponding time 
stamp for last update<br>
</li>

<li>
2.5 Requirement: A device can be standalone which means it does not have to be in a zone or contained in any system<br>
Test: Add a device without linking it to anything and make sure it's not linked to anything.<br>
</li>

<li> 
2.6 Requirement: A device can be added to one or more systems.<br>
Test: Add the device to 1 system and then add it to another system and check for device being in both systems.<br>
</li>

<li>
2.7 Requirement: A device can be a member of a zone without being a member of a system.<br>
Test: Add device to a zone but not a system, make sure device is part of the zone and of no systems.<br>
</li>

<li>
2.8 Requirement: Behavior set is only able to be removed if and only if no devices reference it.<br>
Test: Try removing a behavior set that a device is referencing and removing with no devices referencing.<br>
