<p>Setup Laptops – Lockheed has provided us with two laptops this semester.&nbsp;
The server laptop is being used for development and hosts our data base
and web server.&nbsp; Currently Apache is being used as our web server
in combination with Tomcat to create sample Java Servlet Pages which will
be used to test the data base.&nbsp; The client machine, which is&nbsp;
unable to connect to the LAN at this moment, will be used in our demonstration
to our client.
<p>Test Database&nbsp; – To allow for a more extensive testing of our Data
Base which can be done by any of our group members or our clients online,
we have created a simple UI to test the use cases.&nbsp; This environment
will be used to run sample SQL queries which will in turn be used in our
DB GUI.
<p>Database Iteration Implementation - While implementing the database,
we will come accross areas where the database will need to be revised.&nbsp;
The design will therefore be altered and the implementation process continued.
<p>Database GUI Implementation - Implement a GUI (JSP Pages) to access
the database.&nbsp; The GUI will allow for devices to be added, removed,
and viewed easily, as well as monitoring information about all the devices
in a system or zone.&nbsp; Further implementation will be needed next semester.
<p>Test Database GUI -&nbsp; We will test the GUI that we complete at the
end of the semester.&nbsp; Further testing will be needed next semester
as the GUI continues to be implemented.

<p>Create DB UI to test Back End of Product – A simple UI will be needed
which will perform queries on the Data Base.
<p>Demonstration of Back End of Product – We plan to perform a demonstration
of the back end of this product to our client at the end of the semester.&nbsp;
This demonstration will include the desired features described above in
the simple UI.

<br><b><font size=+1>ORIGINAL SHORT TERM GOALS NOT TO BE COMPLETED THIS
SEMESTER</font></b>
<p>Originally, we had planned to create an extensive User Interface which
enables devices to be added, removed, and viewed easily, as well as monitoring
information about all the devices in a system or zone.&nbsp; Instead, we
are creating an interface to meet these needs but that will need further
development on in order to meet all of the clients requirements and GUI
desires.&nbsp; We will test the UI we complete.
<p>REASONS
<p>The previous semester’s group created a Data Base, written in Microsoft
Access, which originally was thought to be complete.&nbsp; Our Short Term
Plan at the beginning of the semester reflected this, as we planned to
work more on the front end User Interface and testing of the back and front
ends together.&nbsp; After several meetings with our clients, it was decided
that the Data Base from last semester did not address Lockheed’s problem
sufficiently, and therefore, we decided to create a new Data Base.&nbsp;
This major new goal has taken approximately 5 weeks.&nbsp; This amount
of time was necessary in order to completely understand the details of
Lockheed’s extensive system of devices and their behaviors, as well as
how they interact with each other in the forms of zones and systems.&nbsp;
We feel that we now have a fairly complete understanding of Lockheed’s
problems and what they expect from this system, and can pass this on to
future groups through this semester’s documentation and as well as in meetings
next semester.&nbsp; Communication with our clients has also slowed the
data base creation process, as it is difficult to find times when both
our group and our clients can meet.&nbsp; Meetings are typically scheduled
every Friday at 11:00 am in the form of a conference call to our clients
in Moorsetown, New Jersey.&nbsp; We still plan to have a simple User Interface
that will be used to test the completeness of the Data Base we have created
this semester.

<p><img SRC="status.GIF" height=325 width=788>
<br>This semester we completed most of the diagram above.&nbsp; We started
out by modifying the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/RWL/Projects/lockheed/webdocs/requirements.html">requirements</a>
<br>from last semester to meet our clients' needs.&nbsp; We then proceeded
into the design and the
<br>implementation phases, first for the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/RWL/Projects/lockheed/webdocs/design.doc.html">database</a>
and then for the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/RWL/Projects/lockheed/webdocs/dbdoc.html">user
interface merging</a>.&nbsp; After creating
<br>the database and user interface, we began <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/RWL/Projects/lockheed/webdocs/test.plan.html">testing</a>
both.&nbsp; Since the database implementation was
<br>finished before the front-end, testing was completed on the back-end.&nbsp;
Next semester will finish testing
<br>the user interface.
