<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=+1>Meeting Summary</font></font></b>
<p>Our goal for this meeting was to take turns in presenting our project,
status, and prototype as well as obstacles and solutions.&nbsp; Questions
were asked periodically throughout both informal presentations.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>Brett and Mike started off by giving a description of the project and
the short term goals.&nbsp; Mike then displayed a diagram on the database
setup on web and Levi spoke on the details of the database design.&nbsp;
Levi continued by displaying screenshots including the logon, user, and
device screens with mechanisms to add/remove a user and to add/remove a
device from the system.&nbsp; He explained that eventually, this setup
will apply to zones and systems.&nbsp; Jeff gave an overview of testing
the use cases through a service provided by rootnode including actions
to view tables, add/remove users, add/remove users, and to enter SQL code.&nbsp;
He explained that these actions run against the same database setup that
the JSP pages with the screenshots do on the laptop, but where the rootnode
facilities test the use cases, the screenshots actually are the user interface
to manipulating the database system.
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=+1>Q&amp;As</font></font>
<p>Jessica:&nbsp; How far back in recording information in the database
must you go for a particular device?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike:&nbsp; The entire lifetime of the device
<p>Jessica:&nbsp; Why use the rootnode facilities?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff:&nbsp; To test the use cases with hand-typed
SQL
<p>Jessica:&nbsp; What languages are you using?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brett:&nbsp; SQL Server and JSP

<p>Zach began by stating problems the group has encountered in reaching
their short term goals.&nbsp; He said that they had great difficulty in
setting up a development server due to communication problems and that
their clients understood their setback.&nbsp; He then proceeded in explaining
the database setup including the tables STUDENT, UNIFORM, and SKILLS.&nbsp;
He said that in the future there will be more tables added to the database
to keep track of band members and items.&nbsp; He also explained that the
group has difficulty communicating and meeting with the diverse schedules
of the group members.&nbsp; Jessica stated that they are implementing their
project in mySQL and PHP which Zach says has a tool PHP MyAdmin that adapts
with mySQL.
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=+1>Q&amp;As</font></font>
<p>Brett:&nbsp; Is this your first semester working on the project?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jessica:&nbsp; Yes.
<p>
<hr><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=+1>Conclusion</font></font></b>
<p>The meeting lasted one hour and went relatively smoothly.&nbsp; Jessica
and Tamrah documentated the minutes to post on their webpages.&nbsp; It
was beneficial to do peer reviews with two similar projects since both
projects contained a database back end and web-based front end and both
groups have a good many people and can relate in task distribution as well
as group comminication.&nbsp; It was interesting to see the differences
between the two groups given a similar set of requirements - software choice,
progress, problems, etc.&nbsp; Overall both groups seem to be communicating
well with the clients and adhering to their short term plans and documenting
cut-backs.
