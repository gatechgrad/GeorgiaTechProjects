<p><b><font size=+2>Testing Strategy</font></b>
<p>1.&nbsp; Primary Testing consisting of:
<br>Unit testing the components of the database to make sure that every
part works correctly by utilizing the rootnode.com testing environment
to individually test the SQL tables and SQL statements used to modify the
database.&nbsp; Testing each of the requirements listed in the requirements
document by using the tests involved for each of the requirements.&nbsp;
Some of the requirements have multiple tests that need to be tested to
determine if the requirement was met.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>2.&nbsp; Customer testing using beta front-end with:
<br>The Lockheed members are able to test the backend with the front end
we provide and the server laptop being up on a static IP address so they
are able to test it across the Internet.  Students in the group are able to test the database utilizing the same
procedures that Lockheed will be using.<br>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+2>Testing Problems</font></b>
<p>While creating the database we ran into many discrepancies with Lockheed
on the requirements.&nbsp; So we changed the requirements of the database
design and the overall system requirements as we progressed through the
project to take into account the ever-evolving project.&nbsp; This pushed
off the time available for coding, which in turn pushed off the time where
testing was to come into play on the database, since less time was able
to be devoted to the testing phase.&nbsp; Although we were able to test
the SQL statements and tables using the rootnode.com testing environment
while the actual server and front-end were being coded.&nbsp; So when either
of them was changed the testing environment was changed.
<p>The testing environment allowed us to work with Lockheed and the rest
of the group in an online environment without having to meet in person
or via a conference call.&nbsp; This also allows the future groups working
on this project to get a good idea of the use cases and SQL commands used
in the project so they may design the final front-end accordingly and get
a good understanding of what the project is doing.

<p><b><font size=+2>Testing for Next Semester</font></b>
<p>This semester we did not have time to actually test the live database
on the server or the prototype front-end, although we were able to test
the code on Rootnode.  The code was tested on rootnode fairly well but the database went through
many interations of deveolpment so the latest version(s) were unable to be fully tested.  Rootnode
is almost fully functional on the use cases with their corresponding actors and the actions available
to the actors.  Thus the requirements are down but the design isn't set in stone yet.&nbsp; <br><br>
<font size=+1>
Steps for next Semester</font>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Retrieve and setup client and server laptops<br></li>
<li>Familiarize with rootnode.com testing environment and read up on the testing and requirements documents<br></li>
<li>Use current Rootnode.com test environment to test all the requirements listed in the requirements document by using the corresponding test(s) for each requirement<br></li>
<li>If an error occurs:<br></li>
<ul>
<li> Document each error with exact steps used to produce error<br></li>
<li> Determine if the error is incorrect SQL code used to interact with the database or due to a database implementation/design problem<br></li>
<li> Correct problem and note the change in the documentation (rootnode keeps versioning information and change history also)<br></li>
</ul>
<li> After all changes have been processed using the Rootnode.com testbed, the SQL statements and SQL code should be migrated over to the updated or new front-end and back-end<br></li>
<li> The process should then be completed as above testing on the actual front-end and back-end server applications<br></li>
<li> Lastly the group should get Lockheed involved with testing it via the web and should simulate the users on the front-end<br></li>
<li> Everything a user can do should be checked.  Examples being right clicking on a button instead of left clicking or clicking a button repeatedly<br></li>
</ul>
