Accomplishments this week (with hours spent on each task):
<ul>
<li> Helped Tamarah create documenton for rootnode.
<li> Made the rootnode  easier to use. (5 hours)
<li> Reviewed all emails and documentation and started fleshing out 
rootnode. (8 hours)
<li> Collaborate with mike about finalizing the database design.
</ul>
Goals for next week
<ul>
<li> Import the remainder of the work into the testing environment.
<li> Test the system
<li> Create script which will allow a third party to verify that the tests 
passed.
 </ul>
Problems encountered this week.
<ul>
<li> Mike is upset at me because I didn't write the documentation for 
rootnode.  I know stress is up, but we have prepared well for it.  We
have very good requirement documentation, a functioning testing environment, 
and the begginings of the user interface.  In other words we are in testing
mode, how many other groups do you think made it to teting.
I think that it is important to focus on what needs to be done and 
continue working gracefully. <hr>

Task Report for Oct 6, 2000


<pre>
Tasks done last week.

Meetings                          3 hours.
Worked on database design         2 hours.
Worked on presentation            3 hours.
Created and Digitized ER Diagram  2 hours.

Problems this week. (and rambling)
The Database design seems to be the bottleneck.
Since getting the database accurate is a much
higher priority for the customer than building
a software shell; the work load distribution
between members is limited to our ability to
collaborate on the design.  Collaboration has
been very high and every one is pitching in
and making suggestions/changes and communicating
with the client.  We have been submitting 
lots of deliverables.  Personally I am not that
excited about the direction of the database
design.  I am very pleased that my group 
beleaves that software development
is inherently difficult; a point which I have
tried to make many times.  I am glad that
understaning the client and getting this
database correct is our number one priority.
