Accomplishments this week</p>
1 hour: Group evaluation with Band group<br>
2 hours: group meetings<br>
1 hour: wrote database documentation with Tamrah for the website<br>
2 hours: database and JSP development<br>
- rewrote the user login code using separate Login and User beans instead of one UserBean that handled login and everything.<br>
- currently the interface allows the user to log into the system with a username and password, view a list of devices and the behavior set related it, and and change their password; it also allows administrators to add new devices, add new users.  When Mike and Brett finish the SQL writer class I will add it to the database package.  I currently have the SQL statements hardcoded into the DatabaseConnection class. 

<p class="heading_text">Goals for next week</p>
start thinking about bringing the project to an end this semester

- I learned the syntax and semantics of SQL earlier this semester, but I am just now learning how professional databases are actually set up;  I'm starting to wish I had taken a database course before signing up for this class<br>

<p class="heading_text">Problems this week</p>
- the only way I was able to access the Lockheed database through Java was by setting the Lockheed database as the default in the data source in the ODBC Control Panel applet; there should be a way to access different databases in a data source through Java, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet; or maybe it's Micro$oft's way of giving Java developers a hard time(j/k).<br>
- all team members need to write up their own damn status reports and not copy and paste from mine<br>
