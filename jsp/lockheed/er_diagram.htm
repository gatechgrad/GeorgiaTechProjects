      <DIV id=text>The objective of Lockheeds project is to create a database 
      capable of tracking devices. These devices are capable of reporting their 
      status, tempature, flow rate and so on..<BR>The database should be capable 
      of storing the location of the device. The device supplier and its 
      maintanence records.<BR>The database must be capable of storing future 
      devices and capture its readings which will not be defined until the 
      device is installed.<BR>The database entities are device, system, zone, 
      supplier, maintainer, and measurement type. (measurement type = 
      behavior)<BR>As you can see in the diagram a device can be related to a 
      system by grouping. Devices are logicly grouped into systems. Systems can 
      be related to each other in a hierarcy. With this design a system can be a 
      substem of another system and so on. Another organizational tool lockheed 
      requested was the ability to place devices in a zone. Here you can see a 
      device is related to a zone by the zoning table.<BR>It is also of interest 
      to have the ability to connect a device to another device. In the ER 
      Diagram below you can see that two devices are related by a 
      connection.<BR>And obviously a device is related to a supplier by an 
      installation and a device is related to a maintainer by its maintence 
      records.<BR>The tricky part of the ER Diagram is to allow a device to 
      record its measurements when the measurement types that the device records 
      is unknown until installaion.<BR>We prepose to solve this by relating a 
      device to measurement types with a dynamicdb. The dynamicDB relation 
      stores all the information to properly extract from the runtime created 
      table which will store the devices measurements.<BR><IMG alt=erdiagram
