The year is 2002.

First Major Joe Killalot is stationed near the Tora Bora
caves in Afganistan.  Today he enters the caves to hunt down
the number one terrorist leader in the world, Osama bin Laden.
Joe will face many obstacles on his spelunking adventures
through the caves, and face many enemies such as turncoat John
Walker and General Musharf.  To make this mission worthwhile
to Joe, President George W. Bush has agreed to allow Joe to
keep all of the Taliban's treasure that he finds while skowering
the cave.  Joe will need every bit of his strength to find the
terrorist mastermind.  Will he be able to make it??
