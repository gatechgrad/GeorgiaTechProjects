<H1>CS 2200 - Fall Semester 1999</H1><B>Programming Assignment II (Scheduler and 
Paging Daemon)</B> <BR><B>Posted: September 16, 1999</B> <BR><B>Due: Midnight, 
Friday, October 8, 1999</B> 
<P><B>Learning Outcome:</B> 
<P>The learning outcome intended through this project is to give you the 
confidence in building pieces of the operating system. Specifically, you will 
write a process scheduler that manages the processor resource, and a paging 
daemon that manages the available physical memory in the computer. 
<P><B>We provide:</B> 
<P>To make this doable in the given timeframe, we will provide you the 
following. 
<UL>
  <LI>A simulated processor that has the following resources visible to the OS: 
  <OL>
    <LI>R[0..7] - a register-file with 8 elements 
    <LI>PC - a program counter The processor interface to the OS for starting a 
    program is: proc_START(address); This will result in the processor setting 
    PC to the value specified by "address" and starting the program at that 
    address. 
    <LI>PTR - a register that contains the address of the page-table for the 
    currently running process. 
    <LI>VPN - a register that contains the virtual page number of the faulting 
    address. 
    <LI>PHYSICAL_MEM - a set of 20 physical memory frames 
    <LI>VIRTUAL MEM - a set of 100 virtual memory frames available for each 
    process 
    <LI>The processor catches two types of exceptions: PAGE-FAULT and TIMER. The 
    OS can ask to be interrupted upon these exceptions by specifying handlers to 
    the processor. The interface to the OS provided by the processor for 
    installing exception handler is: proc_INSTALL_HANDLER(handle, 
    EXCEPTION-TYPE) Upon an exception the associated handler will be called by 
    the processor. </LI></OL>The header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the processor to the operating system. 
  <LI>The set of application processes that need to be scheduled on the 
  processor and their behavior. Each process is described by the initial values 
  to be loaded into the registers R[0..7], the entry-point address where process 
  execution begins, and the address of the page table for this process. 
</LI></UL>The processor functionality and the application processes will be 
implemented as a library (see the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile 
</A>) that should be linked in with the code you implement. 
<P><B>You Implement the following pieces of the operating system:</B> 
<UL>
  <LI><I>A round-robin scheduler:</I> <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P>This is used to schedule the set of processes on the processor. At the 
  start of the program you will read in a configuration file which will have the 
  format shown <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/config.txt">here</A> 
  and do the initial set-up for the processes specified in the configuration 
  file. There will be one line for each process in the config file. Each entry 
  gives the name of the process, the address of the entry point procedure for 
  the process, and the values to be loaded into the processor registers R[0..7]. 
  Also at program startup you will install the handlers for the two exceptions 
  handled by the processor using the proc_INSTALL_HANDLER call defined in the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h 
  </A>header file. 
  <P><I>Data Structures: </I>You will maintain a (process context block) PCB for 
  each process that contains the state of the process: the values of the 
  processor registers, the PC, and the address of the page table for this 
  process. You will construct a "ready queue" for the processes for scheduling 
  them on the processor. 
  <P><I>Scheduler routine: </I>Upon timer expired exception, you will save the 
  context of the currently scheduled process, and enqueue it at the tail of the 
  ready queue. Then select the process at the head of the queue and dispatch it 
  on the processor. </P>
  <LI><I>A paging system:</I> <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P><I>Data structures: </I>For each process you will maintain a page-table as 
  an array of page-table entries indexed by the virtual page number. The 
  structure of each entry in the page table is given in the header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/os_pte.h">os_pte.h 
  </A>. Also, you will maitain a global pool of free physical memory frames. 
  <P><I>Paging routines: </I>Upon a page fault exception, you will obtain a free 
  physical memory frame and assign it to the faulting virtual page. If there are 
  no free physical frames then you will evict a physical frame and assign it to 
  the faulting address. The victim page will be chosen at random. If the chosen 
  page happens to be dirty, then it has to be written back to disk. The header 
  file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/util.h">util.h</A> 
  gives you the prototypes for two functions the library provides for saving and 
  loading pages: 
  <UL>
    <LI>savePageToDisk and 
    <LI>loadPageFromDisk </LI></UL>
  <LI><I>Dispatcher: </I>Once a process has been selected by your scheduler, the 
  dispatcher loads the context of the selected process into the processor and 
  starts execution of the process by calling proc_START function defined in the 
  <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A> 
  header file. </LI></UL><B>Making the executable for your project:</B> 
<P>You are given the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile 
</A>which you can use to make your executable object file for the project. You 
must also obtain the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/index.html">library 
and other goodies</A> needed for building your project. 
<P><B>What to turnin?</B> 
<UL>
  <LI>Your scheduler and paging Daemon should store a log file of their 
  activity. The format of the Log file for the scheduler may look something like 
  <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/sched-log.txt">this</A>. 
  Each entry gives the name and register values of the process being preempted, 
  the name and register values for the process selected to be scheduled next, 
  and the size of the ready queue. <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P>The format of the Log file for the paging daemon may look something like <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/paging-log.txt">this</A>. 
  Each entry gives the name of the faulting process, the VPN of the faulting 
  address, the victim page selected, whether the victim page was from free pool 
  or stolen from another process, and the state of the page (dirty or clean). 
  <P>You should turnin these <B>logs</B> and your <B>source code</B> for the 
  project.</P></LI></UL><B>How to turnin?</B> 
<P>You can turn in your projects using the<A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/turnin.html"> Workon 
facility</A>. 
<P><B>Extra Credit:</B> 
<P>All extra credit will be treated separately and not added to the total score. 

<UL>
  <LI><I>Approximate LRU algorithm for Page replacement: </I>You will implement 
  an approximate "least recently used" algorithm for determining the victim 
  page. To do this, you will use the reference bits associated with each 
  physical page frame. This bit is set by the processor whenever the associated 
  page frame is accessed. A processor instruction "proc_clear_reference_bit" is 
  available to clear the reference bit associated with a particular page frame. 
  This function is described in the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project2/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A> 
  header file. You can see Chapter 9.5 of S&amp;G textbook for ideas on 
  approximate LRU algorithms. </LI></UL><B><A
