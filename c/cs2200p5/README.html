<H1>CS 2200 - Fall Semester 1999</H1><B>Programming Assignment V (Reliable 
Transport Protocol)</B> <BR><B>Posted: November 19, 1999</B> <BR><B>Due: 
Midnight, Thursday, December 9, 1999</B> 
<P><B>Learning Outcome:</B> 
<P>The learning outcome intended through this project is to give you a feel for 
implementing a reliable transport protocol. Specifically, you will gain 
experience in scatter/gather of a message into packets, dealing with packet 
headers, maintaining packet sequence numbers, packet buffer management, and 
dealing with upcalls. 
<P><B>Description:</B> 
<P>There are four components that complete this project: <B>(1) application 
threads that generate message requests to the reliable transport layer </B>, 
<B>(2) a reliable transport procotol (RTP) </B>, <B>(3) a device driver for the 
network </B>, and <B>(4) an unreliable network (tobynet) </B>. We will provide 
you the first, third, and fourth components and you do the second. 
<P>Applications that use your reliable protocol will use the following calls: 
<OL>
  <LI><I>rtp_send(dst, buffer, len) </I>: This is a blocking call for the sender 
  and return from the call guarantees the sender that the message has been 
  delivered to the destination node specified in "dst". 
  <LI><I>rtp_recv(src, buffer, len) </I>: This is a blocking call for the 
  receiver and when the call returns the arguments will contain the source of 
  the message, the contents, and the length of the message. </LI></OL>Your 
reliable transport protocol layer will implement these two calls. Take a look at 
the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/proj5-pix.GIF">interaction 
picture</A> to see how the components fit together. The center-piece of this 
picture (shaded portion) is what you are responsible for in this project. An 
application thread (T1) will periodically send a message using <B>rtp_send</B>. 
Another application thread (T2) will periodically do a receive using 
<B>rtp_recv</B>. You have to write the code that will (a) provide the API calls 
<B>rtp_send</B> and <B>rtp_recv</B>, (b) packetize and send the messages, (c) 
implement the <B>upcall</B>, and (d) receive the packets and assemble them into 
a message to service the rtp_recv call from the application thread. 
<P><B>We provide:</B> 
<P>To make this doable in the given timeframe, we will provide you the 
following. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Unreliable Network (Tobynet) </B>: <BR>This network may deliver packets 
  out of order. You do not have to directly interface with this network since we 
  are providing a network driver. 
  <LI><B>Network Driver</B>: The header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/net.h">net.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the network driver to the reliable protocol 
  layer. It provides the following calls: 
  <OL>
    <LI><B>net_pkt_send(dst, buf, len) </B>: This call sends a packet in "buf" 
    of "len" to the "dst" node. There is a maximum length limit for "len"; "buf" 
    should have been allocated using "malloc" by the caller; the network driver 
    is responsible for freeing the memory associated with "buf". 
    <LI><B>net_src_address(buf, src) </B>: This call allows the RTP layer to 
    determine the source address of a packet that it received in an upcall. 
    "buf" is the address of the buffer which was passed to the RTP layer in the 
    upcall. 
    <LI><B>net_reg_upcall(handler) </B>: This call registers the pkt_recv_upcall 
    handler with the network driver. 
    <LI><B>net_free_buf(buf) </B>: This call frees the buffer that was passed up 
    by the upcall from the network driver. 
    <LI><B>net_init() </B>: This call will create the network driver thread (D) 
    shown in the <A 
    href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/proj5-pix.GIF">interaction 
    picture</A>. </LI></OL>
  <LI><B>Two application threads</B>: <BR>These two application threads will 
  respectively be the sender and receiver threads and are the clients of your 
  reliable transport layer. These threads (T1 and T2) shown in the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/proj5-pix.GIF">interaction 
  picture</A> will be created when your program calls a function <B>app_init() 
  </B>provided as part of the library. This function is defined in the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/app.h">app.h</A> 
  header file. </LI></UL>Tobynet, the network driver, and the application threads 
will be implemented as a library (see the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile 
</A>) that should be linked in with the code you implement. 
<P><B>You Implement the following pieces of code for the reliable transport 
protocol:</B> 
<UL>
  <LI><I>rtp_send() and rtp_recv() </I>: These are blocking calls made by the 
  application threads. You will provide the entry points for these two calls. 
  Take a look at the prototypes for these two entry points in the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/rtp.h">rtp.h</A> 
  header file. You will block the sending thread until the send is completed and 
  an "ACK" message has been received. You will block the receiving thread until 
  the message is fully assembled and ready to be handed to the receiving thread. 
  For the rtp_send call, you will give the message to be sent to the send thread 
  (S) via some shared data structure in your RTP layer, and signal the send 
  thread that it has work to do. For the rtp_recv call, you will check if a 
  message has already been assembled and ready to be handed over. If not you 
  will block the thread until the message is ready to be handed over. If yes, 
  you will complete the call by returning the expected values in the place 
  holders provided in the call. <BR><B>Note </B>: The reliable transport layer 
  is responsible for allocating memory for the message that is being assembled. 
  It is the responsibility of the application thread to free this memory. 
  <LI><I>Main Program </I>: At the start, the <I>main program </I>to be written 
  by you will do any necessary initialization of data structures needed in your 
  transport layer. These include: 
  <OL>
    <LI>creating the data structures for the different pieces of code in your 
    layer to communicate with one another, as well as the mutexe and condition 
    variables for protecting accesses to these shared data structures, 
    <LI>initializing the network driver by calling <B>net_init()</B> which 
    creates the network driver thread, 
    <LI>registering the upcall handler in the network driver using 
    net_reg_upcall, 
    <LI>creating a send_thread (S) and a receive thread (R), </LI></OL>After all 
  the initialization is done, your main will call <B>app_init()</B> which will 
  create the application threads. After doing this you can simply let the main 
  program wait for one of its children in a pthread_join statement. 
  <LI><I>Upcall code for receiving packets from the network driver </I>: This 
  body of code will be called by the network driver when it has a packet to 
  deliver. You will parse the header in the incoming packet to determine if it 
  is a DATA or ACK packet. If it is the former then you will give it to the 
  <B>recv_thread (R) </B>. If it is the latter then you will give it to the 
  <B>send_thread (S) </B>. You will appropriately signal the corresponding 
  thread to indicate the packet arrival. See the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/proj5-pix.GIF">interaction 
  picture</A>. 
  <LI><I>Receive thread functionality </I>: Every incoming data packet has a 
  header as described in the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/rtp.h">rtp.h</A> 
  header file. The payload (i.e. the data portion of the message) immediately 
  follows the header in the incoming packet. If it is starting to assemble a new 
  message, then it allocates a buffer (since the total size of the message is 
  known from the header) for holding the entire message. It then assembles the 
  incoming packets into this buffer noting that the packets may actually arrive 
  out of order. Once the entire message has been assembled, if an rtp_recv is 
  already pending then it will signal the waiting thread. It will also send an 
  ACK packet using the <B>net_pkt_send </B>call defined in <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/net.h">net.h</A> 
  header file. This thread should also free up the packet buffer that was handed 
  to it by the network driver using the <B>net_free_buf </B>call defined in the 
  <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/net.h">net.h</A> 
  header file. 
  <LI><I>Send thread functionality </I>: This thread is responsible for breaking 
  the message to be sent into packets, and attaching a send header to each 
  packet. The format of the send header is described in <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/rtp.h">rtp.h</A> 
  header file. It will call <B>net_pkt_send </B>repeatedly to send the packets 
  of the message to the destination node. Note that this thread has to allocate 
  memory for each packet using {<I> malloc</I>} before calling <B>net_pkt_send 
  </B>. The network driver is responsible for freeing this memory when it is 
  done with the transmission of the packet. So the RTP layer does not have to 
  free the memory allocated for the packets by the <B>send_thread </B>. After 
  all the packets have been handed over to the network driver, then this thread 
  will wait for the ACK packet. Once an ACK is received, it will signal the 
  application thread (which is waiting in the rtp_send entry point procedure) to 
  continue execution of that thread. 
  <LI><I>Data Structures: </I>You will have to maintain communication areas for 
  data transfer among the code blocks you will write in the transport layer. 
  </LI></UL>In the file <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/skeleton.c">skeleton.c</A> 
we provide the skeleton for the program that you have to write. 
<P><B>Limitations of the network to make your job easier </B>: <BR>There are 
several limitations that we have placed on the network to make your job easier: 
<OL>
  <LI>The network is not connected to anything! This means you can only send 
  messages to yourself using Tobynet. The application thread we provide will 
  basically be sending messages with the destination field set to a 
  distinguished value <I>NET_DST_SELF </I>. 
  <LI>There is only one application thread that sends messages and there is only 
  one application thread that receives messages. This means that in the reliable 
  transport layer at any time you have to deal with only ONE message that has to 
  be packetized and sent, and only ONE message that has to assembled for 
  reception. </LI></OL>
<P><B>Programming </B>: <BR>As in Project 4, you will use the pthreads library 
on Solaris to develop this project. 
<P><B>Notes:</B> 
<OL>
  <LI>Your main program after doing the initializations creates two threads: a 
  <B>send_thread (S)</B> and a <B>recv_thread (R)</B>. 
  <LI>The entry point procedures for rtp_send and rtp_recv are executed by the 
  respective application threads that call these procedures. 
  <LI>The upcall for receiving and parsing an incoming packet is executed by the 
  network driver thread. 
  <LI>Thus there are only 6 threads total for the life of the program: 3 created 
  by you and 3 created by us when you call the app_init and net_init library 
  calls (see the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/proj5-pix.GIF">interaction 
  picture</A>): 
  <UL>
    <LI>the main thread that does the initializations and then does nothing once 
    the send and receive threads are created 
    <LI>the send_thread (S) 
    <LI>the recv_thread (R) 
    <LI>the network driver thread (D) 
    <LI>the two application threads (T1 and T2). </LI></UL></LI></OL><B>Making the 
executable for your project:</B> 
<P>You are given the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile 
</A>which you can use to make your executable object file for the project. You 
must also obtain the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project5/provided/index.html">library 
and other goodies</A> needed for building your project. 
<P><B>When to terminate the program?</B> 
<P>The library we provide will automatically terminate the whole program after 
doing some number of sends and receives using your reliable transport. 
<P><B>What to turnin?</B> 
<UL>
  <LI>You should generate a log file of the send/receive activity in the 
  reliable transport layer. You are free to choose whatever format you like. 
  Each entry should contain the contents of the packet header for the message 
  that is being sent by the send_thread, or the packet header for the packet 
  that is received during an upcall. Additionally, you may want to associate a 
  message-id (you can generate this sequentially for each message you are 
  sending/receiving) with the packets being sent, and the DATA and ACK packets 
  being received. 
  <P><BR>You should turnin the <B>log file </B>and your <B>source code</B> for 
  the project. </P></LI></UL><B>How to turnin?</B> 
<P>You can turn in your projects using the<A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/turnin.html"> Workon 
facility</A>. 
<P><B>Extra Credit:</B> 
<P>All extra credit will be treated separately and not added to the total score. 

<P>You can enhance the reliable transport protocol to handle the following 
additional network nasties: 
<UL>
  <LI>The unreliable network may corrupt the data portion (i.e. the payload) of 
  the packets coming in. Note the header WILL always be good. 
  <LI>The unreliable network may occasionally drop packets (DATA as well as 
  ACKS). You will have to introduce NACK packets to handle this situation, and 
  use TIMEOUTS on the send side as well. </LI></UL><B><A
