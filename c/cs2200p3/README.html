<H1>CS 2200 - Fall Semester 1999</H1><B>Programming Assignment III (Disk Device 
Controller Design)</B> <BR><B>Posted: October 11, 1999</B> <BR><B>Due: Midnight, 
Friday, October 29, 1999</B> 
<P><B>Learning Outcome:</B> 
<P>The learning outcome intended through this project is to give you the 
confidence in building controllers in hardware for peripheral devices. 
Specifically, you will write a C program (<I>a la</I> Project 1) that will 
embody the datapath and control for such a device controller. 
<P><B>Description:</B> 
<P>There are four pieces of programs that complete this project: 
<B>processor</B>, <B>memory</B>, <B>device</B>, and <B>device controller</B>. We 
will provide the first three pieces and you will do the fourth piece. Take a 
look at the interaction picture&nbsp; <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/proj3-hw-pix.GIF">(hardware)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/proj3-sw-pix.GIF">(software)</A>&nbsp; 
to see how the program pieces fit together. The device controller responds to 
commands from the processor. The controller has a set of <B>registers</B> that 
are readable and writable by the processor: <I>contr_command</I>, 
<I>contr_mem_address</I>, <I>contr_count</I>, <I>contr_surface</I>, 
<I>contr_track</I>, <I>contr_sector</I>, and <I>contr_status</I>. In your C 
program simulating the device controller you will define the following variables 
to represent the above registers and <B>export</B> them to the processor: 
<OL>
  <LI>enum contr_command_t contr_command; 
  <LI>int contr_mem_address; 
  <LI>int contr_count; 
  <LI>int contr_surface; 
  <LI>int contr_track; 
  <LI>int contr_sector; 
  <LI>int contr_status; </LI></OL>You will have an entry point function in your 
device controller program <I>contr_START</I>, which you will <B>export</B> to 
the processor. The processor will set the device registers and call the entry 
point procedure. Calling the entry point procedure will start your device 
controller simulation using the datapath and control embodied in your program. 
Upon completion of the command, the device controller will interrupt the 
processor to indicate completion of the command. 
<P>Use the C template given to you in Project 1 as the starting point for your 
coding. The datapath and control should be considerably simpler than what you 
had to do for Project 1. In addition to the registers mentioned above, you will 
need an ALU (for keeping track of bytes transferred), a hardware buffer to store 
the data in/out of the device to/from memory, a way of generating the interrupt 
vector, etc. Correspondingly, you will need control inputs to actuate these 
resources. Your FSM to control the controller should also be considerably 
simpler than Project 1. 
<P><B>We provide:</B> 
<P>To make this doable in the given timeframe, we will provide you the 
following. 
<P>NOTE: DO NOT WAIT UNTIL A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE DEADLINE TO GET STARTED. WHILE 
THE TAs MAKE THE BEST EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE LIBRARIES ARE FULLY DEBUGGED IT 
IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HAVE OVERLOOKED SOMETHING WHICH MAY SURFACE WHEN YOU 
INTERFACE YOUR PROGRAMS WITH THE LIBRARIES. THIS IS THE OTHER REASON YOU WANT TO 
GET STARTED TODAY!! 
<UL>
  <LI>A simulated processor that will drive your controller program. The 
  processor provides an <B>interrupt</B> line and an <B>interrupt 
  acknowledge</B> line. A C function call is provided to assert the interrupt 
  line: <I>proc_ASSERT_INTERRUPT()</I>. The interrupt acknowledge is simulated 
  by a variable <I>proc_acknowledge</I> defined in <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A>. 
  The processor will respond by asserting the interrupt acknowledge line 
  (setting the <I>proc_acknowledge</I> variable to 1). Your program will convey 
  the interrupt vector corresponding to your device to the processor upon 
  getting an interrupt acknowledge (your prgram will wait for 
  <I>proc_acknowledge</I> variable to become 1). A C function call is provided 
  to do this: <I>proc_SEND_INTERRUPT_VECTOR(DISK_INTERRUPT_VECTOR)</I>. The 
  value for the DISK_INTERRUPT_VECTOR is defined in <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A> 
  header file. <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P> 
  <P>The header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the processor to the device controller. </P>
  <LI>A simulated memory that provides the following interface calls: 
  <I>mem_READ(address, &amp;data)</I>, and <I>mem_WRITE(address, data)</I>. 
  <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P> 
  <P>The header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/mem.h">mem.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the memory to the device controller. </P>
  <LI>A simulated device (disk in this case) that provides the following 
  interface calls: <I>dev_READ(&amp;buffer)</I>, <I>dev_WRITE(buffer)</I>, and 
  <I>dev_SEEK(surface, track sector)</I> <BR>&nbsp; 
  <P> 
  <P>The header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/dev.h">dev.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the device to the device controller. </P>
  <LI>Your program will be exercised by an input file that has the format shown 
  <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/input_file.txt">here</A> 
  Each line in this input file are the values that will be set to your 
  controller registers by the processor before calling contr_START. You can look 
  at this file to see the format of the input that will be read in by the 
  simulated processor. </LI></UL>The functionalilty provided to you will be 
implemented as a library (<B>libp3.a</B>) that should be linked in with the code 
you implement. 
<P><B>Making the executable for your project:</B> 
<P>Start with the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile</A> 
provided for this project and make the necessary changes per your implementation 
to create an executable. The header file <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/proc_processor.h">proc_processor.h</A> 
should be included in each of your C program files (see <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/controller.c">here</A> 
for an example) This will automatically include the definitions provided in the 
other header files (mem.h and dev.h). You must also obtain the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project3/provided/index.html">library 
and other goodies</A> needed for building your project.

  signals for actuating them. (You can hand draw this if you want.)
