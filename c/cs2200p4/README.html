<H1>CS 2200 - Fall Semester 1999</H1><B>Programming Assignment IV (Multithreaded 
OS)</B> <BR><B>Posted: October 31, 1999</B> <BR><B>Due: Midnight, Friday, 
November 19, 1999</B> 
<P><B>Learning Outcome:</B> 
<P>The learning outcome intended through this project is to give you a feel for 
building a multi-threaded OS that does CPU and I/O scheduling. Specifically, you 
will write a <I>non-preemptive CPU scheduler </I>that manages a <I>CPU </I>, and 
an <I>I/O scheduler </I>that manages an <I>I/O processor</I>. You will implement 
each of these schedulers as a <B>pthread </B>to get familiarity with the pthread 
library available on most Unix operating systems. 
<P><B>Description:</B> 
<P>There are three major components that complete this project: <B>application 
processes </B>, <B>OS </B>, and <B>hardware </B>. We will provide the first and 
third components and you do the second component. Take a look at the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/proj4-pix.GIF">interaction 
picture</A> to see how the components fit together. The center-piece of this 
picture (shaded portion) is what you are responsible for in this project. An 
application process alternates between computing on the CPU and making 
<B>blocking </B>system calls to the OS for I/O operation. You have to write the 
OS that (a) schedules these application processes on the CPU, (b) responds to an 
OS_CALL from the process that is currently scheduled on the CPU, (c) schedules 
the requested I/O on the I/O processor (IOP), and (d) handles I/O completion 
interrupt from the hardware. 
<P><B>We provide:</B> 
<P>To make this doable in the given timeframe, we will provide you the 
following. 
<UL>
  <LI><B>CPU </B>: <BR>This is a simplified version of the processor that you 
  were given in Project 2. A simulated processor that has the following 
  resources visible to the OS: 
  <OL>
    <LI>R[0..7] - a register-file with 8 elements 
    <LI>PC - a program counter The processor interface to the OS for starting a 
    program is: proc_START(address); This will result in the processor setting 
    PC to the value specified by "address" and starting the program at that 
    address. 
    <LI>The CPU catches one interrupt: I/O-COMPLETION. The OS can ask to be 
    interrupted upon this exception by specifying a handler to the processor. 
    The interface to the OS provided by the processor for installing exception 
    handler is: proc_INSTALL_HANDLER(EXCEPTION-TYPE, handle) Upon an exception 
    the associated handler will be called by the processor. </LI></OL>The header 
  file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/cpu.h">cpu.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the CPU to the operating system. 
  <LI><B>I/O processor </B>: <BR>A simulated I/O processor that performs I/O 
  when instructed by the OS. The I/O processor has the following resources: 
  <OL>
    <LI>IOP_CMD - a command register that can be set to one of IOP_READ or 
    IOP_WRITE. 
    <LI>IOP_DATA - a register that contains the data read if the command is a 
    IOP_READ operation; if the command is a IOP_WRITE then this register 
    contains the data to be written to the device. 
    <LI>IOP_STATUS - a status register that contains the completion status of 
    the command issued to the I/O processor. This will be one of IOP_SUCCESS or 
    IOP_FAILURE. </LI></OL>The interface provided by the I/O processor to the OS 
  for starting an I/O operation is: iop_START(). This should be called by the OS 
  after the above resources have been set. The I/O processor raises the 
  I/O-COMPLETION interrupt upon completion of the I/O operation which is caught 
  by the CPU and delivered to the OS via the handler installed by the OS. The 
  header file <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/iop.h">iop.h</A> 
  gives the interface provided by the CPU to the operating system. 
  <LI><B>A set of Applications </B>: <BR>The set of applications that need to be 
  scheduled on the CPU and their behavior. Each process is described by the 
  initial values to be loaded into the registers R[0..7], and the entry-point 
  address where process execution begins. Each application computes for a while 
  and makes an I/O call. Upon an I/O call the I/O command is given in R[6]. If 
  the command is IOP_READ then the data from the device is expected in R[7]. If 
  the command is a IOP_WRITE then the data to be written is in R[7]. The 
  application expects the completion status of the I/O command issued in 
  R[5].</LI></UL>The CPU and the I/O processor functionality, and the applications 
will be implemented as a library (see the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile 
</A>) that should be linked in with the code you implement. 
<P><B>You Implement the following pieces of the operating system:</B> 
<UL>
  <LI><I>OS_CALL() </I>: This is a blocking system call that will be called by 
  the application to indicate to the OS that it wants to do an I/O operation. 
  The application will set R[6] and R[7] as described above. The success or 
  failure of the I/O operation will be returned in R[5] when this process is 
  resumed on the CPU. You will provide this entry point as part of your OS, and 
  do the necessary actions for CPU and I/O scheduling as described below. 
  <LI><I>Main Program </I>: At the start, the <I>main program </I>to be written 
  by you will read in a configuration file which will have the format shown <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/config.txt">here</A> 
  and do the initial set-up for the processes specified in the configuration 
  file. There will be one line for each process in the config file. Each entry 
  gives the name of the process, the address of the entry point procedure for 
  the process, and the values to be loaded into the processor registers R[0..7]. 
  Also at program startup you will install the handler for the I/O-COMPLETION 
  interrupt handled by the CPU using the proc_INSTALL_HANDLER call defined in 
  the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/cpu.h">cpu.h 
  </A>header file. <BR>After this initial set up, the main program will create 
  two <I>pthreads </I>that represent the CPU scheduler and the I/O scheduler 
  respectively. 
  <LI><I>A non-preemptive CPU scheduler:</I> This will be implemented as a 
  <I>pthread </I>. This is used to schedule the set of applications on the CPU. 
  <BR><I>Data Structures: </I>You will maintain a (process context block) PCB 
  for each application that contains the state of the process: the values of the 
  processor registers, and the PC. You will construct a "CPU ready queue" for 
  the processes for scheduling them on the processor. You will also keep a 
  "DEVICE queue" for the processes that need to perform I/O action. <BR><I>CPU 
  Scheduler routine: </I>Upon an OS_CALL from the application, the scheduler 
  will save the context of the currently scheduled process, dequeue it from the 
  CPU ready queue, and place it at the end of the DEVICE queue. It will then 
  signal the I/O scheduler to indicate that there is work for the I/O scheduler 
  to do (see the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/proj4-pix.GIF">interaction 
  picture</A>). The CPU scheduler will then select the process at the head of 
  the CPU ready queue and dispatch it on the CPU. If the CPU ready queue is 
  empty then the CPU scheduler will await a signal from the I/O scheduler. 
  <LI><I>I/O scheduler:</I> <BR>This will also be implemented as a <I>pthread 
  </I>. This is a FCFS scheduler that does one I/O operation at a time. It takes 
  the process at the head of the DEVICE queue, and calls the <I>iop_START 
  </I>function on behalf of this process. This will also provide the handler 
  code for dealing with I/O-COMPLETION interrupt. If the DEVICE queue is empty 
  then the I/O scheduler will await a signal from the CPU scheduler (see the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/proj4-pix.GIF">interaction 
  picture</A>). 
  <LI><I>I/O-COMPLETION interrupt handler </I>: Since the I/O scheduler does one 
  operation at a time, the interrupt will always signal the completion of the 
  I/O initiated on behalf of the first process in the DEVICE queue. Upon I/O 
  completion (indicated by the I/O-COMPLETION interrupt), the handler will stash 
  the IOP_DATA from the device (if it is a IOP_READ operation), and the 
  IOP_STATUS from the device into the PCB of the process at the head of the 
  DEVICE queue. It will then move this PCB to the tail of the CPU ready queue 
  and signal the CPU scheduler to indicate that it has work to do. That will be 
  the end of the handler function. 
  <LI><I>Dispatcher: </I>Once a process has been selected by your scheduler, the 
  dispatcher code loads the context of the selected process into the processor 
  and starts execution of the process by calling proc_START function defined in 
  the <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/cpu.h">cpu.h</A> 
  header file. </LI></UL>In the file <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/skeleton.c">skeleton.c</A> 
we provide the skeleton for the program that you have to write. 
<P><B>Programming Tips </B>: 
<P>In this project you are writing a multi-threaded program using the 
<I>pthreads </I>library. The system call <I>pthread_create </I>allows you to 
create a new thread (see the man page for this function). Each thread is a 
distinct computational activity that executes concurrently. However, all the 
threads share the same <I>address </I>space. This means you have to be careful 
when accessing global data structures (such as the CPU and DEVICE queues). In 
particular, you should ensure mutual exclusion using <I>pthread_mutex_lock 
</I>and <I>pthread_mutex_unlock </I>system calls (see the man pages for these 
functions) on variables of type <I>pthread_mutex_t </I>before accessing shared 
data structures.

<P><B>Notes:</B> 
<OL>
  <LI>Your main program after doing the initializations creates two threads: a 
  CPU scheduler and an I/O scheduler. 
  <LI>The CPU scheduler thread runs your OS code for selecting a process to 
  schedule on the CPU and then becomes that process itself by calling 
  proc_START. 
  <LI>Similarly, the I/O scheduler thread decides the I/O to perform on behalf 
  of a process and then carries out that I/O operation by calling iop_START. 
  <LI>Thus there are only 3 threads total for the life of the program: 
  <UL>
    <LI>the main thread that does the initializations and then does nothing once 
    the scheduler threads are created 
    <LI>the CPU scheduler thread 
    <LI>the I/O scheduler thread </LI></UL></LI></OL><B>Making the executable for 
your project:</B> 
<P>You are given the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/makefile.txt">Makefile 
</A>which you can use to make your executable object file for the project. You 
must also obtain the <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/index.html">library 
and other goodies</A> needed for building your project. 
<P><B>When to terminate the program?</B> 
<P>The library we provide will read in a file <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/iocommands.cfg">iocommands.cfg</A> 
(see <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/provided/index.html">library 
and other goodies</A> for more details) to generate the OS_CALL commands to your 
OS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THIS FILE IN YOUR PART OF YOUR CODE. Every line of 
this fine contains <BR>{IO_COMMAND} {data} {expected status of the call}. 
<BR>The library will terminate your program when it runs out of commands from 
this file. So you do not have to hit CTRL-C to terminate your program. This is 
the input file for which you have to generate your final output for turnin. 
<P><B>What to turnin?</B> 
<UL>
  <LI>Your CPU and I/O schedulers should store a log file of their activity. The 
  format of the Log file for the schedulers may look something like <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2000/cs2200_fall/project4/sched-log.txt">this</A>. 
  You are free to choose whatever format you like. Each entry should give the 
  following information: who is initiating this action (I/O or CPU scheduler), 
  what is the action (e.g. move from CPU to DEVICE queue), contents of the PCB 
  that is being moved, and the sizes of the CPU and the DEVICE queues. 
  <P><BR>You should turnin the <B>log file </B>and your <B>source code</B> for 
  the project.</P></LI></UL><B>How to turnin?</B>
