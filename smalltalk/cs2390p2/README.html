<P>How do you know if a Web page is changed? You read over the page, hope that 
the author put some marks where something has changed, and at least put the 
changes right at the top or right at the bottom. Now, how you can do it 
algorithmically? Of course, you could save a copy of the page and do some kind 
of differential analysis (<I>diff</I>) on the two versions. But that eats up 
lots of space. Can you boil it down to just a couple numbers, or at least, a few 
characters? A length of a page is a good indicator. But how about another? 
Maybe... 
<UL>
  <LI>Grab the first three and last three characters on a page? 
  <LI>Grab the first characters of each of the first five 
  <LI>Add up the ASCII values of the first 10 characters on a page? 
  <LI>Maybe the first 10 and the middle 10 and the last 10? 
  <LI>Maybe just count key things like the number of paragraph markers 
  (&lt;p&gt;)? 
  <LI>Maybe combine several values by concatenating them (remember the comma is 
  the string concatenation operator in Smalltalk) </LI></UL>
<P>You are to write a piece of code that can compute key values: a length and 
some kind of <I>checksum</I> or <I>indicator</I> values. <B>Your limitation is 
15 readable ASCII characters.</B>. The length in ASCII, you can assume, will 
always be less than 99,999 characters. The goal is to come up a characteristic 
string that will change when and if the page changes.
<P>I want to be able to use your code like this: <CODE><PRE>HTMLPageCharacterization for: 'http://www.cnn.com' 
</PRE></CODE>
<P>which should return a 15 character code for that page.
<P>
<H3>Implementation Hints</H3>
<P>See the class HTTPSocket, especially the example class methods, for how to 
grab a page. Your code should work for http:// <B>and</B> file:// URLs.
<P>News pages are good pages to use as examples. http://www.cnn.com can change 
frequently in useful ways.
<P>
<H3>Scenarios</H3>
<P>
<LI>A class News page always has a date and a new entry at the top of the body 
of the page, but doesn't change the header of the page. How does your 
characterization deal with that? 
<LI>The page that you reference has a large table as a navigation bar, and the 
frequently changing content is halfway down the page. How does your 
characterization deal with that? 
<P>

<H2>Grading</H2>
<P>You must turn in both code and <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/8.html">Design 
Documentation</A>. You will submit your code to cs2390@prism.gatech.edu before 
class time. You will also hand in printed code and printed documentation.
<P>
<H3>Grading Criteria</H3>
<P>DESIGN DOCUMENTATION (50 points) 
<UL>
  <LI>5 for Diagram: Correct in notation, doesn't break any semantic rules 
  (e.g., subclass = is-a). 
  <LI>10 for Good CRC: Makes sense, detailed 
  <LI>10 for Good Overall Quality OOA/D: HAS MORE THAN ONE CLASS ON IT, follows 
  rules in <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/7.html">Criteria for 
  Good OOA/OOD</A> (e.g., no class is named as a verb). 
  <LI>5 for Scenarios 
  <LI>10 for Reasonable Detail in OOA/D -- you could code from it 
  <LI>10 for Reuse -- makes sense, is believable, doesn't involve redefining 
  anything. </LI></UL>
<P>CODE (50 points)
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Below points assume http: and file: URLs work -- half of the points are 
  for each type. 
  <LI>10 Recognizes changes in title of page (near the top) 
  <LI>10 Recognizes changes in beginning of body of page WHERE LENGTH DOESN'T 
  CHANGE 
  <LI>10 Recognizes changes at end of page WHERE LENGTH DOESN'T CHANGE 
  <LI>10 Recognizes changes in middle where length does change 
  <LI>10 For none of the test cases does the result ever exceed 15 characters. 
  </LI></UL>
