<P>Everyone has too much information to deal with. Websites, even collaborative 
ones, newsgroups, email, etc. are overwhelming us. Websites and newsgroups are 
particularly insidious because they grow without us noticing.
<P>In this assignment, you will define a system to help you monitor activities 
in each of these.
<P>I expect you to use your system like this: <CODE><PRE>myMonitor := NewsMonitor new.  "Create a newsmonitor"
myMonitor lastUpdate: 3/31/99'. "Show me everything new since 3/31/99"
myMonitor add: 
   (NewsgroupChecker for: 'git.cc.class.2390'). "I want to see new things in the git.cc.class.2390 newsgroup"
myMonitor add: 
   (CowebChecker for: 'http://pbl.cc.gatech.edu/cs2390/recent.html'). "I want to see what's new since 3/31/99 in the 2390 CoWeb"
myMonitor add: 
   (WebChecker for: 'http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/' 
   limit: 'http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/'
   since: 'webcrawl'). 
   "Show me all new pages since those recorded in the 2390webcrawl file. 
Only follow links that are preceded with 'http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/' 
Updates the 2390webcrawl file with new crawl data."<P>
myMonitor processTo: 'new.html'. "Do the checking, creating an HTML file with all the new things"
myMonitor processAndShow. "Do the checking, to whatever file the system chooses, then open Scamper on the result." 
</CODE></P></PRE>
<P>What appears in the HTML file (and in Scamper) should be a well-formatted 
display of the news information: 
<UL>
  <LI>Links to each web page that changed 
  <LI>Links to each CoWeb page that changed 
  <LI>HEADERS-ONLY (titles and authors and dates) of all new newsgroup postings 
  <LI>Appropriate headers and horizontal rules to make the information more 
  readable. </LI></UL>
<P>
<H3>Scenarios</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Teacher has added a new note to the bottom of a News page, which is linked 
  to the home page. How will you find it and display it? 
  <LI>There are no new newsgroup postings since the last specified date. 
</LI></UL>
<P>
<H3>Tips on Implementation</H3>
<P><B>DO NOT USE YOUR DESIGN FROM A1!</B> You've learned things since then. 
Improve your design.
<P>To read newsgroups, try <TT>SimpleClientSocket nntpTest</TT>. You may want to 
use some of the PatternTransform projects on the <B>Cases</B> (<A 
href="http://pbl.cc.gatech.edu/cs2390/8.html">http://pbl.cc.gatech.edu/cs2390/8.html</A>) 
page to find the date. And remember that the Date class can convert a lot of 
date formats -- you may not need to do the parsing yourself.
<P>To read webpages, try <TT>HTTPSocket httpShowPage: 
'www.altavista.digital.com/' </TT>. To determine if a webpage has changed, use 
your checksum method from <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/19.html">Assignment 
2</A> (Yes, you can improve it.) To open a file in Scamper, try this code: 
<CODE><PRE>	| browser |
	browser := Scamper new.
	browser jumpToUrl: 'file://',filename.
	browser openAsMorph. 
</PRE></CODE>

<H2>Grading</H2>
<P>DESIGN DOCUMENTATION (50 points) See <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/8.html">Design 
Documentation</A> on what is expected.
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>10 for Diagram: Correct in notation (10), doesn't break any semantic rules 
  (e.g., subclass = is-a) (10). 
  <LI>15 points for Good Overall Quality OOA/D: HAS MORE THAN ONE CLASS ON IT, 
  follows rules in <A 
  href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/7.html">Criteria for 
  Good OOA/OOD</A> (e.g., no class is named as a verb) (10). Includes all the 
  classes and services required by the above examples. 
  <LI>5 for Good CRC: Makes sense (10); detailed list of collaborators and 
  responsibilities (10). 
  <LI>5 for good treatment of Scenarios: Detailed description of how the pieces 
  fit together. 
  <LI>5 for Reuse -- makes sense, is believable, doesn't involve redefining 
  anything. </LI></UL>
<P>PROGRAM GRADING (50 points)
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>10 Handles CoWeb updates correctly -- that is, gets all changes since 
  (including) the specified date, puts them in a file with valid links. 
  <LI>15 Handles newsgroup updates correctly -- that is, gets all new notes 
  since the specified date, puts them all in the HTML file, formats them 
  appropriately. 
  <LI>15 Handles webcrawling correctly -- visits all the necessary pages and no 
  others, stores the crawl data in the specified file. 
  <LI>5 Handles web page updates correctly -- finds all the pages changed since 
  the last crawl, 
  <LI>5 Opens scamper on the output file </LI></UL>
