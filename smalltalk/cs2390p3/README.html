<H2>Design and Implement an HTML Page Viewer</H2>
<P><B>YOU MUST WORK IN TEAMS OF TWO TO FOUR ON THIS PROJECT!</B> The cost of not 
working on a team is an immediate 15 point deduction on your grade.
<P>When you turn <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/18.html">Assignment 
1</A> in, by the end of class, I want a sheet of paper from each group listing 
the group members, their email addresses, and phone numbers. You can use the 
team page at <A 
href="http://pbl.cc.gatech.edu/cs2390/1332.html">http://pbl.cc.gatech.edu/cs2390/1332.html</A> 
to advertise for your team. 
<HR>

<P>I want you to write Smalltalk code to: 
<UL>
  <LI>Read an HTML page from an http:// or file:// URL 
  <LI>Display the page for a subset of HTML in a 640x480 area on the screen 
  <LI>Provide scroll buttons at the top and bottom to scroll down (half-page) or 
  back up (if already scrolled down.) </LI></UL>
<P>The subset of HTML that you will support will be: 
<UL>
  <LI>Breaks: &lt;br&gt; 
  <LI>Paragraph marks: &lt;p&gt; 
  <LI>Bold, italics, and underline: &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;, &lt;ul&gt; 
  <LI>Center: &lt;center&gt; 
  <LI>Horizontal rules: &lt;hr&gt; 
  <LI>Headings following these rules: 
  <UL>
    <LI>&lt;h1&gt; are all uppercase and underline and boldface 
    <LI>&lt;h2&gt; are all uppercase and boldface 
    <LI>&lt;h3&gt; are all uppercase 
    <LI>All other levels are just displayed as a separate paragraph </LI></UL>
  <LI>Anchors, but not with clickable links. Just display the anchor text in 
  italics WITH THE COMPLETE REFERENCED URL (not just relative links) IN 
  PARENTHESES AFTER THE ANCHOR TEXT. &lt;a 
  href="http://somewhere/something.html"&gt;some anchor text&lt;/a&gt; </LI></UL>
<P>For extra credit (5 points), you can support images (GIFs, JPEGs, and BMPs), 
just displayed in-line, no sizing or formatting: &lt;image 
src="http://somewhere/something.gif"&gt;. If you don't support images, just 
display the word IMAGE in its own paragraph at the image marker.
<P>In doing this project, you may not use any windows, menus, buttons, or text 
areas built-in to Squeak. You must display graphics directly to the screen 
(suggestion: clear out a 640x480 area with white, first), and you read the 
Sensor to determine if the mouse has been clicked and where.
<P>I want to use your code like this: <CODE><PRE>HTMLViewer on: 'http://www.cc.gatech.edu/index.html' 
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
<H3>User Interface</H3>
<P>You must provide a way to scroll up and down long pages. It is up to you to 
come up with a usable scroll system. Buttons at the top and bottom? Scroll bar 
with "thumb"? You decide, but you have to post the graphics yourself, do your 
own event loop, and handle scrolling. Scrolling should scroll about 1/2 page at 
a time.
<P>
<H3>Implementation Hints</H3>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The tricky part here is probably not going to be the formatting, but the 
  word wrapping. How do you know when to wrap a line and start a new line? 
  <LI>Most of what you need to display formatted text is in the Text class. Look 
  at the various supports for attributes and the classes TextAttribute, 
  TextFontReference, TextFontChange. 
  <LI>Text's know how to display strings with attributes, but the actual display 
  (e.g., where on the screen, how much space on the screen) is handled in 
  DisplayText. 
  <LI>To get the size of a displayed text chunk, explore the below code: <CODE><PRE>www _ DisplayText text: ('www' asText) textStyle: TextStyle default copy centered.
lll _ DisplayText text: ('lll' asText) textStyle: TextStyle default copy centered.
www display.
lll display.
Transcript show: (www form boundingBox printString) ; cr.
Transcript show: (lll form boundingBox printString); cr 
</PRE></CODE></LI></UL>
<P>
<H3>Scenarios</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>What happens if someone goes to a page with frames or tables? Suggestion: 
  Ignore them gracefully, no crashes. 
  <LI>How do you display a large GIF on one page, and three pages of text on the 
  next, and then what do you do when someone scrolls forward one page? </LI></UL>
<P>
<HR>

<H2>Grading</H2>
<P>You will need to turn in your <A 
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs2390_99_spring/8.html">Design 
Documentation</A> which includes your code -- ONE PER GROUP. You can turn in to 
any section that you have a member from. EACH GROUP MEMBER will also need to 
mail your code to cs2390@prism.gatech.edu with the subject line "prj3, 
123456789,d" where 123456789 is your student number and "d" is your section (a, 
b, c, or d).
