<H2 align=center>1. Making Money</H2>
<P>Making money is by far the most important part of TradeWars 2002. Here are 
some hints to help improve your trading effectivness.
<H5></H5>
<HR>
<A name=bestprice>
<H4 align=center>1.1. Getting the BEST price at ports</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Eugene Hung</H5>
<P>All ports have a <B>best</B> price, which one will get 5 experience points if 
one bids that exact number. The best price is determined by the number of holds, 
if uneven, then the best price is usually a fraction, though I am not sure, 
since I always get holds in groups of 5 and 10, up to my maximum. Some ports 
have just <B>one</B> best price, those are the easy ones. Let us say one is in a 
StarMaster with 70 holds(the most useful ship for robbing and attacking). Get a 
psychic probe to help determine the best price. The first time, either accept 
the port's initial offer for no experience, or bid a little higher than what 
they offer. The psy-probe will tell you how far you were off from the best 
price, then you steal the 70 equipment, and use your calculator to figure out 
the best price and nail it on the head for 5 exp. each time. However, most ports 
have more than one best price(which I will explain). You must use a different 
strategy for this, which is an extension of the strategy I just previously 
outlined. 
<P>Ok, so you have a psychic probe, and have just found out ONE best price. Port 
again, and look carefully at the initial offer. If the offer is within 20 
credits or so of the previous time(when you sold 70 equ to them at an absurdly 
low price), the best price is the same as last time, and so you should bid your 
calculated best price from last time. You may be off a credit or two, but 
eventually you'll figure out the best price through the probe. Now, let us 
hypothesize that inital offer is substantially different than last time(around 
50-90 credits). That means the best price has <B>moved</B>. But, after lots of 
testing, I discovered that the best price can only move up or down in multiples 
of a certain number, n. <B>That number is the number of your holds.</B> Thus, 
going back to the example, the port's best price can fluctuate up or down 
multiples of 70. Knowing this, you look at the initial offer, see whether it 
went up or down from last time, estimate how many multiples of n it went up or 
down, and bid the best price plus 70 * roughly how much it went up or down. This 
is a little confusing, so I'll illustrate: 
<P>Let us say the port offers 9600 credits for 70 equ. You accept the offer, and 
figure out with your psy probe and calculator that the best offer was 10199. You 
steal the 70 equ back. Now you port again. If the offer still is around 
9600(9580-9620), bid 10199. Voila, 5 exp. If you continue to steal-sell, and the 
offer varies very little, this is a one-price port. However, if the offer ever 
deviates by 50 or more, it is NOT a one-price port. So let us say the 2nd time, 
the port offer 9665(65 more than last time). Since you have 70 equ to sell, the 
port's best price must have gone UP by 70 credits(since the offer went up around 
70 creds). So one bids 10269, or 10199 + 70. You steal, and port. The port 
offers 9510 credits, or 90 below 9600. That's around 70 below the original best 
price, so you bid 10129, or 10199 -70. You steal, and port. The port now offers 
9650, around 50 above 9600, so the best price is probably 70 above this time, so 
it's 10269. You steal, and port. The offer is now 9385. That's roughly 210 
credits(70 * 3) below, so you bid 10199 - 210, or 9989 credits. 
<P>As you can see, <B>all the best prices are related</B> by the <B>number of 
holds</B>. This strategy also works in other ships, such as a Corp FlagShip with 
85(bid up or down multiples of 85 from the first figure). 
<P>There is a flaw, though. One may not estimate the number correctly. In the 
previous example, what if the port offered 9635? One could not tell whether the 
best price was the same, 10199, or 70 up, 10269. <B>in cases of doubt, 
overbid.</B> What I mean by that is, bid the higher figure, in this case, 10269. 
If it WAS 10269, I get 5 exp. If it was 10199, the port will raise its bid by 
20-21 creds(30% of # of holds), also raising the best price by 21 credits(30%). 
<B>The best price changes</B> through overbids, by 30% of the difference between 
the bids, towards your offer. So, let us say we misestimated, and bid 10269. The 
port now offers 9655, which means we were over by 70, so we bid 10199 + 21(30% 
of 70), or 10220. Bingo! Realize, if one <B>under</B>bids, the port will 
immediately accept the offer, and you will get only TWO exp, for being 99.31% 
off or so. So always choose the higher figure, when in doubt. And if you 
overshoot by 140, the port offer goes up by 40 or so, so the best offer goes up 
by 42 credits(30% of 140), and you should bid 98(140 -42) credits less to get 
the best price.

<H4 align=center>1.2. How do I steal?</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by David White</H5>
<P><B>Question: What are the tricks to stealing?</B> 
<P>A player with -100 or lower alignment can steal credits and goods from ports. 
There is ALWAYS a chance of being busted while trying to rob a port, but some 
good guideline ratios are: 
<P>your experience / 20 = holds you can steal<BR>your experience * 10 = credits 
you can steal. 
<HR>
<A name=stealsell>
<H4 align=center>1.3. The steal/sell cycle</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Joel Downer</H5>
<P>The basic steal-sell cycle works as follows: find a port that's selling 
equipment, and steal or buy 150 holds. (When you're using ports identified with 
EVILPAIR.COM, it's actually smarter to buy than steal your first load. Don't 
risk making a port angry with you when you may need to buy fuel ore there the 
same day!) Move to a port buying equipment -- preferably a port at 100%. Sell 
the equipment for the best price you can negotiate (see the section on the 
five-experience point trick, below. Now, port and <I>steal back the equipment 
you just sold</I>. Sell the equipment again, steal it, and repeat the process 
until you're caught or out of turns. When you get caught, you'll lose 13 holds 
(out of 150) and 10% of your experience. Sometimes you'll be caught more often 
than you like, but if you steal a sensible amount (no more than one hold per 15 
experience points), you'll typically make more than enough to compensate for the 
trouble. 
<P><B>Important:</B> When you get caught, write down the location and the date. 
You won't be able to port there for at least 14 days without getting busted 
again (even if you just port to *trade*, you may get nailed). After a couple of 
weeks, you can go back and work the ports again. 
<P>The five experience-point cycle works as follows. The first time you dock at 
a port, accept the port's first offer for your equipment. Write down the offer, 
and using a calculator and the results from your psychic probe to calculate and 
round off the best price. (E.g.: first offer was 19,200; psychic probe reports 
96.69% of best. Best price = 19,200 / .9669 = (int)19857.2 = 19857. 
<P>Steal back the equipment and dock again. If the first offer if within half 
your number of holds (75 in a StarShip) of the first offer from last time (19125 
- 19275) bid the number that you calculated last time (19857). If the offer is 
substantially higher or lower, adjust the best price by a multiple of your 
number of holds. If the offer is 19,325 (125 higher), bid 150 higher; if the 
offer is 265 higher, bid 300 higher; if it's 700 higher, bid 750 higher. 
<P>When in doubt, overbid. If the port refuses your initial offer, you can still 
often get the five experience points; just understand that the best price will 
*change*, by 30% of the difference between your offer and the original best 
price. 
<P>Example: The port offers 19,278, and you bid 20,007. Oops! The port tries to 
barter, telling you that you guessed wrong -- evidently, the best price was 
still 19,857. Your error has changed the best price by 150 * .30, or 45 credits, 
so the <B>new</B> best price should be 19,902. 
<P>This approach will not work at every port. Some ports don't seem to have a 
best price; at others, the initial estimate with the psychic probe will actually 
be a few credits low or high. If you master this technique, though, you'll be 
able to get five experience points on <B>every sale</B> at many ports, and on 
<B>most sales</B> at many others. 
<P>Price guidelines: <B>very good</B> equipment-buying ports will pay 22,000 - 
23,500 credits for 150 holds of equipment. Spending tons of turns looking for 
the perfect port can end up <B>wasting</B> money, though, because every turn in 
a StarShip is worth at least 9,000 credits. (What's more, tooling around in a 
StarShip when evil is <B>dangerous!</B>) I'm usually content to work a port that 
offers 20,000 for 150 holds, and I'll sometimes put up with ports paying as 
little as 19,000. Ports that only offer 16,000 - 17,000, however, are taking 
things a little far... %ltgrin$gt

<A name=extratradingholds>
<H4 align=center>1.4. How do I get extra holds to trade with?</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Joel Downer</H5>
<P>The bug that makes this trick possible is <B>not</B> the infamous holds bug, 
which allows you to gain rather than lose cargo holds when you try to steal 365 
units of equipment. You can use the holds bug to load your ship with max + 32 
holds, but if you want any more, you'll actually have to <B>buy</B> them. 
<P><B>HOW TO OVERLOAD YOUR SHIP WITH HOLDS:</B> 
<P>To load a ship with extra holds, you must be evil. You may choose any ship, 
but the best choices are the Imperial StarShip (because of TransWarp drive and 
combat capabilities), the Corporate FlagShip (because of TransWarp drive), and 
the Scout Marauder (because of turn rate and combat odds). If you're using a 
FlagShip or Scout Marauder, you can get a lot done with relatively little money. 
If you're using a StarShip, or if you want to load <I>any</I> ship with more 
than 250 holds, you'll need a great deal of money. 
<P>The best way to start is to get your ship to max + 32 using the holds bug: 
let's say you're now in a FlagShip, and you now have 117 holds. Go to Terra, and 
pick up a full load of 117 colonists. Now, find the nearest port that 
<B>sells</B> equipment. Try to steal 364 (yes, THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-*FOUR*) holds 
of equipment. You will lose 32 cargo holds, but, due to a bug in the game, you 
will still be carrying 117 colonists. Next, find a port that sells organics (you 
don't want to use fuel ore, because using fuel ore will make your ship incapable 
of TransWarp; you might choose differently if you're overloading a Scout). Steal 
one hold of organics (what you're actually getting is -64 holds of organics, but 
don't worry about this). When you're done, you will have 53 cargo holds, and 117 
holds full of colonists, with zero empty holds. Now you can go to Sol and buy 32 
more cargo holds: doing so will leave you with 85 cargo holds, 117 holds full of 
organics, and 32 <I>empty</I> holds, for a total of 149 cargo holds. 
<P>You can pick up more colonists and repeat as often as necessary. I'm not 
aware of any limit on the number of cargo holds, but two warnings: (a) the price 
of holds increases geometrically as you buy more and more -- buying a thousand 
holds would cost millions upon millions of credits, and (b) you need to think 
carefully about how many holds you can effectively <B>use</B>. 
<P>The caveats about this trick are the same as for loading your ship with max + 
32: if you surrender to a Ferrengi, get busted, get blown up, or try to buy or 
sell the commodity you used to "cement" your extra holds (usually organics, 
sometimes fuel ore), you'll lose them. Obviously, if you're using a heavily 
overloaded ship for the steal-sell cycle, you're going to lose a great deal of 
money each time you get busted, because you're going to have to repeat all the 
busts and repurchase all of those holds. However, (a) with the right 
combinations, the risk can be *very* worthwhile, and (b) I can think offhand of 
many other interesting uses for this bug.

<H4 align=center>1.5. What happens when I get caught stealing?</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by David White</H5>
<P><B>Question: If I'm busted, can I ever return to that port again?</B> 
<P>Yes, your name will be removed from the port's records in 14 days or as soon 
as another player is caught there, whichever comes first. Until then, do not try 
robbing <I>or</I> trading at that port.

<H2 align=center>2. Planet Stuff</H2>
<P>Planets are a very important part of TradeWars. Without them, no one would be 
able to build up much of anything. Also, without planets, there would be little 
to attack. Here are some tricks to help you make the best of your (and other 
player's) planets. 
<HR>
<A name=superattack>
<H4 align=center>2.1. Super attack method</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Albin Gersich</H5>
<P>If you are landing on a planet that has a military reaction of anything other 
than 0%, and you don't use a photon, and you have more than 6666 Hex (more than 
26214) fighters, then the military reaction of the planet will react at 100%. 
The funny thing about this is that all the fighters on the planet will be lost 
while trying to destroy you, whether they were all needed or not. 
<P>Dan pretty much covered it. Normally only an ISS can have more than 26214 
fighters, and usually they go in during a photon wave so this bug would not come 
into play. With the overloading of fighters bug any ship could have this many 
fighters. What matters is how many fighters the invading ship has left after the 
shields and quasar cannon. This is when the fighter attack routines go into 
effect. If the ship has at least 26215 fighters and the military reaction level 
is non-zero, even 1%, then <B>all</B> fighters on the planet will attack at 2:1 
odds. When this happens <B>all</B> fighters will be lost. Normally only the 
number of fighters that are required to destroy the ship are lost, or all of 
them if there are not enough. When this bug takes effect <B>all</B> the 
planetary fighters are gone, even if there should have been some left. 
<P>Since the photon wave temporarily sets the military reaction level to 0%, 
this bug will not take effect if the wave is still in effect when the planetary 
fighter attack routine is reached. 
<P>From the planets owners point of view, you most likely would destroy his ship 
so he can not reload, but your planet is now wide open and it cost you more than 
it should have. From an invaders point of view this bug can foil your plans. 
Even if the planet has a level 2 citadel this bug will take effect. If you go in 
with a fully loaded ISS to invade a level 2 citadel and wanted to soak off some 
of the fighters by landing and retreating repeatedly, you will instead be 
destroyed.

<H4 align=center>2.2. Getting extra holds for colonist/product transport</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Robert Mudryk</H5>
<P>In a corporation with at least two members:<BR>ex: you have a Star Master, 
your buddy has a Colonial Transport and is in the citedel. Load your ship with 
equipment, go in the citadel and exchange ships, then exit planet. Go back in 
and exchange with the Star Master. Leave the citadel and press <A>take all 
products. Then do the steal 1 org. to lock it in. Repeat as desired. 
<P><B>The holds so gained may be used for <B>transport <U>only</U></B>! They may 
not be sold!</B>

<P><B>Question: What are all the settings for my planetary defenses?</B> 
<P><U>Examples:</U> 
<P>Military Reaction level: 20% -- 20% of all the fighters on the planet will 
attack (at 2:1 odds) any player who moves into your planet's sector. The 
remaining 80% of the fighters will attack (at 3:1 odds) only if the player 
attempts to land on your planet. 
<P>Quasar cannon sector level: 30% -- 30% of all the Ore on the planet will be 
used to fire on a player entering the sector with your planet, causing 1 point 
of damage to the player per 3 units of Ore used. 
<P>Quasar cannon atmosphere level: 60% -- 60% of all the Ore on the planet will 
be used to fire on a player who attempts to land on your planet, causing 1 point

<P>Ferrengal itself is usually a Level 4 planet (Level 3 Citadel - Quasar 
Cannon). It is usually located in a dead end, and the Nebula name will always be 
"The Ferrengi Empire". The planet itself usually <B>starts</B> with the 
following: Colonists: 600 per area, 10000 Ore, some (low) amount of Organics and 
Equipment, 5000 Fighters, 100,000 credits in the Treasury, a Military reaction 
level of 40%, and Quasar levels of 30% (atmosphere) and 0% (sector). Destroying 
or invading Ferrengal by itself will not prevent the Ferrengi from regenerating. 
The sector defense force must also be neutralized <B>and</B> replaced. Once 
destroyed, Ferrengal will <B>not</B> regenerate. If the planet is taken over 
<B>and</B> the sector defense force is replaced by that of a player, then the 
Ferrengi are out of the game, aside from the ships that are still at large. Once 
destroyed, they will no longer regenerate. Taking the planet and <B>not</B> 
deploying your own fighters in the sector is an easy way to get every Ferrengi 
ship to attack you on sight, and they <B>will</B> still regenerate. 
<P>As an aside, the Ferrengi ships base the number of fighters with which to 
attack you upon the number of fighters you carry. If you're being hounded, carry 
a small number of or no fighters and maximum shields. You can then pretty much 
ignore them.

<H4 align=center>3.1. Using just enough fighters</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Kris Lewis</H5>
<P>How to calculate the minimum number of fighters to attack with: <PRE>                (his ftrs) * (his odds)
(your ftrs)  =  -----------------------
                     (your odds)
</PRE>
<P>Ex; If he has a Scout Marauder (2.0:1) and 200 Ftrs, and you have a 
BattleShip (1.6:1), you need to attack with (250*2.0)/1.6, or 312.5 (313) 
fighters. This assumes no shields on his craft and does not account for the 
slight random factor in the calculations the game uses. Shields are at 2:1 odds, 
regardless of shiptype <I>(I think!)</I> 
<P>Ferrengi ship's odds:<BR>Assault Trader - 1.0:1<BR>BattleCruiser - 
1.2:1<BR>DreadNaught - 1.4:1<BR>
<P>Alien ship's odds are the same as player ships of the same type.

<H4 align=center>3.2. Overload your ship with fighters</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by David White</H5>
<P><B>Question: What's the fighter overloading trick?</B> 
<P>Join a corporation, then go to the same sector with a corp member with at 
least as many shields/fighters as you want. Transfer a negative amount of 
fighters/shields to the corp. member. Repeat as often as you like up to a 
maximum of 32,767 fighters/shields. This trick is especially useful with a Scout 
Marauder, which fights at 2:1 odds. Docking at a port, however, will cause the 
excess shields/fighters to vanish.

<P><B>Question: What's the shield overloading trick?</B> 
<P>Use the above technique, or transfer a negative amount of shields to a 
citadel that already has as many ship shields (planetary shields * 10) as you 
need. Docking at a port still causes you to lose any extra shields, however.

<H5 align=center>Originally by David White</H5>
<P><B>Question: Can I kill the Federals?</B> 
<P>No. Zyrain, Clausewitz and Nelson are indestructible. However, you can trap 
them in a dead-end sector by placing a fighter right outside the dead-end, since 
Federals will not travel into a sector that has deployed fighters in it. As long 
as the fighter stays there, all three Federals can be trapped, though Captain 
Zyrain will automatically warp out of the sector to rescue players who qualify 
for protection in FedSpace.

<H4 align=center>3.5. Can I be killed while cloaked?</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by David White</H5><B>
<P>Question: Can I be killed while my ship is cloaked?</B> 
<P>No, while you are cloaked, you are absolutely invulnerable until your next 
login (contrary to the documentation, cloaks do not lose their effectiveness 
over time.) However, if some player were to figure out which sector you were 
cloaked in, he or she could mine your sector. The mines would explode as soon as 
you logged back on.

<A name=trackenemy>
<H4 align=center>3.6. How can I track an enemy?</H4>
<P>To track someone talk to the Grimy Trader in the Tavern. Ask him about 
TRADER. He'll say I can tell you <BLABLABLA>: answer no. Then he'll say "Well, 
is it a particular trader your interested in?". Say yes and enter the name.

<A name=sequence>
<H4 align=center>3.7. The sequence of events in a defended sector</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Albin Gersich</H5>
<P>When you enter a defended sector, the sequence of events is: <PRE> 1:  Mines detonate.
 2:  Quasar cannons fire at sector level.
 3:  If there are fighters in the sector:
         If offensive, they attack.  If toll, the player may pay
         the toll or attack.  If defensive the player may attack.
         After the toll is paid the quasar cannons fire at sector
         level again.  If the player attacks the fighters, after
         each attack round, even if 0 fighters were used in the
         attack, the quasar cannon fighters sector level.  If the
         player does get all the fighters in one shot and attacks
         five times the quasar will fire all five times.  Continue
         until the toll is paid or there are no fighters in the
         sector.

     When the ship attempts to land:

 4:  If the citadel is level 5 and has at least 1 shield, the
     quasar cannon fires at atmospheric level.
 5:  If the citadel is level 5 and has at least 1 shield, the
     player must destroy the shields to continue.
 6:  If the citadel is level 3 or higher, the quasar cannon fires
     at atmospheric level.
 7:  If the citadel is level 2 or highter, the planetary offensive
     fighters attack.  If the ship has 26214 (hex 6666) or less
     fighters, the number that attack is determined by the military
     reaction level.  If the ship has 26215 or more fighters AND
     the military reaction level is not zero, then ALL planetary
     fighters attack and are lost.
 8:  If the citadel is level 2 or highter, any fighters left on
     the planet defend.  The attacker must destroy them to land.
</PRE>
<P>During a photon wave, only steps 5 and 8 are in effect. All others are 
nullified. If the photon wave runs out part way through the sequence, the 
remaining steps will be in effect.

<H2 align=center>5. Starting a New Game</H2>
<P>Everyone has to start a new game sometime. Here are some ideas to help you 
along during the first few days of play if you are new to the game. 
<HR>
<A name=firstdays>
<H4 align=center>5.1. Goals for the first few days of play</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Joel Downer</H5>
<P><B>Question: In a new game, what should be your goal in the first few 
days?</B> 
<P>Let's assume a corporate strategy, for a corp of 3-5 players, to keep this 
simple. (That's what I've usually been playing these days anyway.) Let's also 
assume that we're playing a game with <I>no</I> treaties or rules about the 
shield bug. 
<P>I plan on playing evil wherever I play. I expect to find the StarDock the 
first day of the game -- if it isn't displayed in the Game Status screen, I or 
one of my corp-mates will run FINDSGA to locate it. As soon as we find StarDock, 
we trade in our Merchant Cruisers for Scout Marauders (with the trade-in value 
of the average Merchant, you can buy a Scout with 25 holds and a density 
scanner, and have a little left over with which to go out to dinner <GRIN>). The 
Scout is the single best ship in the early stages because of its move rate. 
<P>My choice from that point depends on the game configuration. If FedSpace is 
open to squatters, my teammates and I will spend the first 3 - 4 days parking in 
FedSpace and working trade pairs to build up experience. I like to use the evil 
Imperial StarShip, so I will try to upgrade to a StarMaster the second day, a 
Mule the third or fourth, get my commission by the fifth or sixth day, and keep 
the StarShip from then on. My teammates will typically turn evil by the fourth 
day (after you have about 375 experience, stealing will be *substantially* more 
profitable than trading); one way I'm likely to get a quick commission is to 
coordinate logins with one of my future teammates so that I can blow my 
<I>future teammate</I> up. 
<P>Objectives for the first 4 - 7 days (depending on the turn rate): to get 
myself into an Imperial StarShip with slightly less than 1,000 experience, and 
to get the team members who <I>won't</I> be in StarShips stealing in StarMasters 
with at least 1,100 experience. We do <I>not</I> usually set aside turns for 
exploration; when we need to find new trade pairs or dead ends, we use ether 
probes. 
<P>Objectives for the next 2 - 4 days: to build a well-concealed planet and 
stock it with 3,000,000 colonists. I will deploy a fighter in a dead-end sector 
and create a planet there. I will frequently ask my future evil teammates to 
deploy fighters and mines <B>in the sector immediately adjacent</B> to the 
dead-end. The fighters and mines protect the planet; I enter and exit the sector 
using TransWarp. 
<P>Objective for the succeeding 1 - 3 days: to assemble the corporation in final 
form. I dump colonists to turn evil, start stealing conservatively, and "bust 
planets" (create and destroy empty planets) to try to build my experience up to 
2,250, where I can steal 150 holds. My teammates steal aggressively. 
<P>Objective for the succeeding three weeks: to build a planet to level five, 
preventing our enemies from building or defending a planet to a level II 
citadel. We use ether probes and search aggressively whenever new citadels 
appear in the game status screen (find as many uses as you can for TWView's 
OFFLINE program, using version 0.91 if you can; you also may want to look at my 
FINDHOLE utility). Because of my p-missile capabilities, I can destroy 
<I>any</I> planet that doesn't have a level II citadel at a trivial cost. We 
upgrade our single planet aggressively, placing the maximum defenses on it at 
any given time (32,000 fighters; 1639 shields the day it turns level V). If the 
relative strengths of the teams in the game justify the move, we may invade 
Ferrengal and either (a) destroy it, or (b) defend it, to prevent our enemies 
from seizing a ready-made level III citadel. 
<P>End-game objectives: If we have a level V citadel, and we can prevent our 
enemies from building or defending a planet, we expect to control the game. We 
continue to steal full-speed, and stockpile money in our shield-bugged citadel 
until the combination of our stealing and treasury interest is overwhelming. 
<P>Through this process, we probably spend 95% of our turns stealing from ports. 
We use the five-point stealing cycle, but we don't otherwise worry about 
experience unless our score is low enough to interfere with our stealing. We 
kill only when absolutely necessary: we expect competent opponents to stay 
cloaked unless they have a reason to <I>want</I> to be attacked. hr&gt; <A

jettison them, log off Trade Wars, log back in, and repeat (-1 alignment per 
colonist jettisoned.) To become good, attack evil traders/aliens/Ferrengi, or 
post a reward on a trader in the Police HQ at Stardock (+1 alignment per 1000 
credits posted.) 
<HR>
<A name=eviliss>
<H4 align=center>7.3. Can an evil player have an Imperal StarShip?</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by David White</H5>
<P><B>Question: Can an evil player have an ISS (Imperal StarShip)?</B> 
<P>You must be commissioned to purchase an ISS, but after you have it, you can 
become evil and still keep the ISS. Running into any of the three Federals 
(Zyrain, Clausewitz, Nelson) however, means certain death. 
<H5 align=center>Originally by Joel Downer</H5>
<P><B>To keep an Imperial StarShip when evil:</B> 
<P>Avoid FedSpace as completely as possible. <B>Never</B> travel through sector 
1-10, and only travel to the StarDock using the strategy described below. Be 
<B>very careful</B> in all areas adjacent to FedSpace, and spend as little time 
on the Major Space Lanes as possible. 
<P>Deploy single toll fighters wherever possible when you travel. The Feds 
cannot travel through sectors with fighters in them, so (a) when you're in a 
sector with a fighter in it, you are <B>completely</B> safe from the Feds, and 
(b) the more fighters you have scattered outside the Major Space Lanes, the less 
the Feds will be able to travel outside the Major Space Lanes. Imprisoning 
Admirals Nelson and Clausewitz would be wonderful, but an evil StarShip captain 
should *never* try it him/herself. It's altogether too dangerous. 
<P>Travel by TransWarp whenever possible. When you <I>must</I> travel by 
conventional warp, use the following pattern: move-deploy-scan, deploying a toll 
fighter immediately in each sector you enter. Whenever you visit the StarDock, 
buy a full complement of ether probes and cloaks: ether probes are necessary for 
blind TransWarp, and cloaks can bail you out if you get stuck somewhere (even 
Zyrain can't attack a cloaked ship!). Carry at least 750 shields and keep mine 
disruptors, in case someone tries to mine you to death; don't carry more than a 
few thousand fighters -- they won't help you if you run into the Feds. <GRIN>
<P>Find out how many entrances the StarDock has -- usually, it'll have one or 
two. If it has one, the approach to the StarDock is pretty simple: fire an ether 
probe into the StarDock, blind TransWarp into the <I>completely empty</I> sector 
nearest SGA. Deploy a fighter immediately, warp in, and do your business. If you 
see one of the Federals at or near the StarDock, put off your business until he 
leaves the vicinity -- you may want to restock your shields or holds at Rylos or 
Alpha Centauri. Don't try to deploy a fighter AT the StarDock; DO deploy a 
fighter at Rylos or Alpha Centauri when you go there. 
<P><BIG>NEVER</BIG>, unless you have some special reason (e.g., hiding the path 
to your planet, remove your fighters when you're done in a sector. Forget about 
the 200 credits. You won't miss them. 
<P><BIG>BEWARE OF MARKER BEACONS!!!</BIG> Marker beacons and wandering aliens 
are the two greatest dangers to blind TransWarp. Never place them, and destroy 
them when you can. 
<P>Don't take unnecessary risks with corbomite. If someone leaves you bait -- 
e.g., if a hated enemy parks in a major transit sector with 0 fighters in a 
Scout Marauder, politely decline the invitation. Well, not <I>TOO</I> politely. 
Leave 99 mines in the sector to let him/her know you still care... ;&gt; 
<P>When you choose stealing sites, look for places where a port that sells 
equipment, a port that sells fuel ore, and a port that buys equipment are in 
close proximity. TWView and my "EVILPAIR" utility are both useful for finding 
these ports.

<H2 align=center>8. Myths</H2>
<P>Over the years, a few myths have come up about TradeWars. Perhaps this will 
help clear some of them up. 
<HR>
<A name=computerup>
<H4 align=center>8.1. There is no computer upgrade</H4>
<H5 align=center>Originally by Kris Lewis</H5>
<P>In version 1.03, there is no such thing as a "computer upgrade" proven. 
Current belief is that it's in the programming as either a timesaver when Gary 
works on 1.10, where it <I>might</I> exist, or as a red herring to those who 
read the game data files.
